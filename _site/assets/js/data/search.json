    "content": "The general availability (GA) for the next evolution of Azure VMware Solution (AVS) was announced yesterday during the Microsoft Ignite 2020 virtual conference. This is a joint partnership between Microsoft and VMware, where Azure VMware Solution is a Microsoft managed service built on Azure bare metal infrastructure and cloud verified by VMware. The initial launch of the Azure VMware Solution in May of 2019 was by CloudSimple; this latest release is built and architected by Microsoft, providing an integrated experience with Azure services. Azure VMware Solution is currently available in the following 10 regions: East US, North Central US, West US, UK South, Japan East, West Europe, North Europe, Canada Central, Australia East, and Southeast Asia. More regions will be available in the future; additional details can be found by searching the Microsoft Products available by region page. Customers running the CloudSimple Azure VMware Solution version also have a migration path to this latest release, leveraging VMware HCX.Azure VMware Solution is powered by VMware Cloud Foundation: vCenter Server, vSphere, vSAN, and NSX-T. Also included is VMware HCX, the Swiss army knife of workload mobility. Customers can securely extend their networks and migrate workloads from on-premises (vSphere 6.x -7.x) to AVS or between AVS private clouds in different regions using a combination of migration options. Microsoft will handle the billing, lifecycle operations (upgrades), and troubleshooting of the service, allowing customers to focus on their workloads.  Note: Updated 3/18/21 to include changes to the service.Getting StartedThere are a few things you need to have in place before you can deploy an Azure VMware Solution private cloud. First, an Azure account, which you can get for FREE. Next, your account must be associated with a subscription that is either part of a Microsoft enterprise agreement or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). Finally, is requesting host quota for your subscription. Once quota is applied to a subscription, search for ‚ÄúAzure VMware Solution‚Äù in the Azure portal‚Äôs search box. Alright, you don‚Äôt need to type out the entire thing; it will appear within the first couple of characters in VMware. An option to deploy your first private cloud in your subscription will be displayed on the next screen. As part of the private cloud creation, there is some basic information needed:  Subscription ‚Äì Billing framework that provides entitlement to deploy and consume Azure resources  Resource Group ‚Äì Logical way to group Azure services  Location ‚Äì Where to deploy the private cloud  Resource Name ‚Äì Name of your private cloud  SKU ‚Äì Node type used during deployment  ESXi Hosts ‚Äì Number of hosts to deploy, min of 3 by default with the option to increase to a max of 16 per cluster  vCenter Admin Password ‚Äì password used to log in vCenter with cloudadmin@vsphere.local  NSX-T Manager Password ‚Äì password used to log in NSX-T manager with admin   Address Block ‚Äì CIDR block used when deploying management components, requires a /22  Virtual Network ‚Äì A representation of cloud networking and provides abstraction and logical isolation. An Azure environment can contain multiple VNets.  Note: Providing vCenter Server and NSX-T credentials during a private cloud deployment is no longer required, they are now auto generated. If they need to be rotated you will currently need to open a support request.[Previous private cloud creation screen][Updated private cloud creation screen]Private Cloud      ExpressRoute ‚Äì Is a private and secure connection from a customer‚Äôs physical datacenter providing dedicated bandwidth into Microsoft Azure.         Global Reach ‚Äì Connects ExpressRoute bi-directionally from a customer‚Äôs environment to Azure VMware Solution.   A subscription can have 1-4 private clouds, each with a maximum of 4 clusters per cloud. An initial private cloud deployment starts with a 3-node minimum with the opportunity to add additional nodes during or scale-up later to a maximum of 16 nodes per cluster in the Azure portal. The hardware specification dropdown lists AVS36 as the current selectable node type. Below is a visual representation of the hardware specs for the AVS36, but it does not represent the actual server üôÇ An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) can be created during the initial private cloud deployment or afterward. If an existing VNet exists, it can also be used. A VNet is created to support an ExpressRoute from Azure VMware Solution to connect to other Azure services and allow connectivity back to an on-premises environment via Azure Global Reach. Once ready, click review and create. After you verify everything entered is correct, click the magical create button and wait for roughly 2+hrs for the process to complete. The process is mostly self-service from the Azure portal allowing you to get from zero to a private cloud which includes:  Provisioning of hardware and backbone networking  Installation and configuration of ESXi, vCenter Server, vSAN, NSX-T, and HCX  Creation of initial cluster including vSAN datastore encryption  Note: if you don‚Äôt have an Azure ExpressRoute, you can use a site-to-site VPN to connect to Azure VMware Solution private cloud, but you will not be able to use HCX for workload migration as this is not supported.Post DeploymentWhen your private cloud is ready, you‚Äôll be redirected to the overview page in the resource menu. This page is handy with valuable information; you can always come back here by searching your private cloud name or simply bookmarking. The first section we‚Äôll want to select is identity. Here is where you‚Äôll find your login information for NSX Manager and vCenter Server. Next is clustering, where you can edit (aka increase/decrease) the number of nodes in a private cloud, with 3 being the magic number of minimum nodes. Keep in mind increasing the number of nodes is tied to your allocation associated with the subscription used.The NSX T-1 router is where all workload network segments need to be created before VMs are deployed or being migrated to a new segment. These segments can be created in NSX manager or directly in the Azure Portal under segments, including the ability to create DHCP servers to handle DHCP requests and DHCP relay services to relay DHCP traffic to external DHCP servers. Additional workload networking options such as port mirroring and DNS are also available.I‚Äôve mentioned VMware HCX; the good news, it‚Äôs automatically deployed as part of the private cloud provisioning. The HCX Cloud manager is where you‚Äôll get the necessary HCX Connector bits to deploy in your on-premises environment, which can be found under the connectivity section in the Azure portal of your private cloud. The HCX Cloud manager address is provided, and you will use cloudadmin@vsphere.local credentials to login and download the HCX connector bits. Licensing your HCX connector is also part of the self-service offering, allowing you to request up to 3 advanced licenses. Additionally, there is an option to upgrade your HCX advanced license to an HCX enterprise license by opening a support request with Microsoft. HCX enterprise will provide features like mobility groups, replication assisted vMotion, mobility optimized networking, and more. These features make use cases like datacenter extension and evacuation easier to any VMware powered cloud.Once the HCX connector is deployed and configured on-premises, customers can access and manage directly from the vSphere client, the dedicated HCX Client, or via automation using PowerCLI or REST APIs. A site pairing can then be established with on-premises environments and an Azure VMware Solution private cloud, followed by L2 connectivity for workloads that will retain their IP addresses. Let the migration planning begin!There are additional support and licensing benefits that come with Azure VMware Solution. Microsoft is providing extended support for Windows Server 2008 and SQL SQL 2008 workloads when they are migrated to Azure, including the Azure VMware Solution. There is also the Azure Hybrid Benefit which is a licensing benefit allowing customers to use their on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure.ResourcesHere are a few resources help get you started in learning more about Azure VMware Solution and more will be added as they are available.

    "content": "Last month Google announced a first-party and fully managed solution called Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE), which was in limited early access since January 2020. Google Cloud VMware Engine is now generally available to all starting in US-east and US-west regions with plans to add eight more regions by the end of the year. When deployed, customers will receive a GCVE private cloud, which consists of ESXi Hosts, vCenter Server, vSAN, and NSX-T running on Google Cloud bare metal. Also included is VMware HCX, which allows customers to extend and migrate workloads from on-premises to GCVE and between GCVE private clouds.As part of the GCVE service availability, customers have several pricing options: on-demand (per-hour), 1yr commitment, and 3yr commitment, which includes the cost of infrastructure, licensing, and support. Billing is handled through Google Cloud; for more details, please see the following. The GCVE service allows customers to focus on workloads while Google manages all other aspects of the service, including the lifecycle of the vSphere environment.GCVE Service* Project ‚Äì must be created as part of the Google Cloud service and is a way to group and manage resources. * Private Cloud ‚Äì is the equivalent of a VMware Software-Defined Data Center (vCenter Server, ESXi, vSAN, and NSX). To get started with GCVE first requires enabling the VMware Engine API in the Google Cloud console. This will need to be done on a per-project basis. Next, you‚Äôll need to request a quota which is located under IAM &amp; Admin. A quota is a way to verify, protect against unexpected usage, and prevent misuse. Each project in Google Cloud could have a different quota. Once your quota request has been accepted, we can start getting ready to deploy a GCVE private cloud.The GCVE service configuration will consist of a minimum of 3 nodes and can scale up to 16 nodes per cluster (roughly 15 mins per node add) or 64 nodes in a single private cloud. Each GCVE node has the following specifications:            CPU ‚Äì 2x Intel Xeon Gold 6240 (Cascade Lake) 2.6 GHz, 36 Cores, 72 Hyper-Threads                  Memory ‚Äì 768 GB          Storage:                          2x 1.6 TB (3.2 total TB) NVMe for cache              6 x 3.2 TB (19.2 TB Total) NVMe for data                                Network ‚Äì 4 x Dual Port 25GbE                    GA included software specifications (keep in mind these versions will change over time):[table id=14 /]Part of the service level agreement (SLA) ensures customers have the needed reliability. GCVE is providing 99.99% of network uptime (less than an hour per year) for its service and has network redundancy across rack configuration. Connectivity from on-premises to GCVE (or between private clouds within GCVE) can be established using a Google Cloud VPN, the quickest method (self-service) to getting started. There is also the option to use Google‚Äôs Cloud Interconnect (available from Google or Service Providers), a dedicated, highly available, low latency direct connection. As part of the configuration process, customers will need to create Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) within the Google Cloud that allows them to control how workloads connect within a region or globally, create policies within projects, and expand IP spaces without downtime. After the VPC is created, workloads can communicate internally within a project, keeping traffic local and providing extensibility to Google Cloud Services.A CIDR block is required to deploy all the vSphere management components within GCVE, but workload networks will be provisioned from NSX-T (NSX segments). There will be DNS servers deployed within a private cloud and are only used for management. Within the network section of the GCVE console, customers can allocate public IP addresses to workloads, which are protected by Google Cloud Edge. The VPN Gateway section provides a point to site VPN that gives access to the management components like vCenter Server within GCVE.There are a couple of things I want to highlight within the GCVE service. First, when it comes to deploying a private cloud, GCVE has fast provisioning, where it takes approximately 30 minutes to deploy a private cloud with all components running (the clock starts when you click on create). On the back end, the GCVE service has built-in intelligence and optimization magic sauce allowing it to pre-provision capacity on unused nodes before they are requested. These nodes are then re-purposed based on the customer‚Äôs specifications and capacity. This ensures deployments are the same as if they were installed from scratch.Second, is how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) works in GCVE. It starts with the Google Cloud console, to gain access to GCVE you either have to be an owner or editor of a project in the Google Cloud console or granted the following roles within a project‚Äôs IAM roles and permissions:                              VMware Engine Service Viewer (read-only access)                          VMware Engine Service admin (full admin access)                                          Once access has been granted, the GCVE portal has three RBAC options: CloudOwner, Elevated Privilege, and Service Provider. The CloudOwner account is the default account; it allows customers the access needed to handle their day-to-day operations on their workloads and provides full access to NSX-T networking (including NSX-T manager). Elevated privilege is a temporary and time-based request that allows access to hosts, storage, and management VMs to create and add identity sources and auth management; this level of access is monitored. The GCVE service monitors actions of the elevate privilege and provides notification if an action is disruptive to the service and the customer, potentially preventing those actions from happening. It also allows the creation and addition of accounts necessary for 3rd party integration, such as backup solutions. Customers can request Elevated Privilege within the GVCE portal on-demand. Service Provider access is only available for Google support only and provides full access to the customer‚Äôs private cloud within GCVE for troubleshooting.When first logging into vSphere Client, you will be prompted to change the default CloudOwner@gve.local account password, which must be changed every 365 days afterward. There are also some pre-created roles that can be used, or you can create your own, but no role can be granted privileges higher than CloudOwner. You can find a list of the GCVE vCenter Server roles and privileges here. GCVE also supports adding your identity solution, which allows you to use your on-premises groups in vCenter Server.All service and access configurations are done from the GCVE console; this includes launching the vSphere Client, network configuration/management, and Private Cloud management (deployment, configuration, and capacity). The GCVE console allows the management of different private clouds from a centralized location. It also provides an activity view that displays alarms, events, tasks, and audits, which tracks all the changes made across private clouds. Customers also have the option to download report information from various sections of the GCVE console in CSV format.Workload MobilityIncluded with the GCVE service is VMware HCX (advanced licensing), which allows customers to migrate workloads as far back as vSphere 5.0 from on-premises to GCVE without re-platforming. It‚Äôs the swiss army knife of workload mobility. VMware HCX Cloud Manager is deployed, configured, and licensed out of the box as part of the GCVE private cloud deployment, requiring a CIDR block for the VMware HCX components. Once the HCX Cloud Manager is deployed, customers can download the HCX Connector OVA to deploy in their on-premises data center, allowing them to pair with their GCVE private cloud. With a site pairing established, HCX provides the option to extend workload networks (L2 Stretch) and migrate using different migration types based on your SLAs: Bulk Migration ‚Äì min downtime, vMotion ‚Äì no downtime, and Cold Migration ‚Äì downtime.Additional functionality and migration types are also included with the HCX enterprise add-on licensing:                              Replication Assisted vMotion ‚Äì the ability to migrate with zero downtime                          Mobility Groups -create migration groups based on criteria and migrate in waves              more                                          These are a few examples of what‚Äôs included with VMware HCX enterprise licensing, contact your VMware/Google representative for more details. This also simplifies uses cases such as data center evacuation, disaster recovery, and hybrid connectivity.ResourcesWith the launch of the new Google Cloud VMware Engine service I wanted to share some resources to help get you started and bookmark:            Google Cloud VMware Engine Documentation                  Release Notes          Known Issues          Service Level Agreement          Prerequisites          Pricing          Ecosystem Partners          Google Cloud Next ‚Äô20 ‚Äì Filtered with VMware as a Service                    "

    "content": "I‚Äôve received several questions lately on what happens to a VM‚Äôs Managed Object Reference (MoRef) ID and InstanceUUID when it‚Äôs migrated across different vCenter Servers using VMware HCX. This information is essential for anything being used to identify VMs, such as provisioning systems, CMDBs, ticketing systems, and backup solutions are examples of tooling using this information.When a VM gets created within a vCenter Server, it generates a MoRef ID that helps uniquely identify it. A MoRef ID gets created not just for VMs but all objects (hosts, folders, datastores, etc.) within a vCenter Server, including the vCenter Server itself. If you‚Äôve heard me talk about using the vCenter Server Migration Tool (Windows to VCSA), I reference the importance of a vCenter Server keeping its MoRef ID, which is how other solutions will identify a vCenter Server. In this case, the Windows vCenter Server MoRef ID gets retained during the migration process, which means any registered solutions will continue to identify the original vCenter Server unknowingly of the migration process üôÇAnother way to uniquely identify a VM within a vCenter Server is by using its instanceUUID, introduced in vSphere 4.0. If you‚Äôve explored inside the VM .vmx file, there is an entry called vc.uuid, which is a 128bit integer and looks something like ‚Äú50 3e 84 9c 71 56 12 29-a6 a7 00 d3 3c a5 d3 28‚Äù. Both MoRef and InstanceUUID information is obtainable using the vSphere API. For more details, I recommend looking at the following blog posts by William Lam. This post builds on the information he provided, focusing on HCX migration types with VM MoRef ID and InstanceUUID.  Uniquely Identifying Virtual Machines in vSphere and vCloud Part 1: Overview  Uniquely Identifying Virtual Machines in vSphere and vCloud Part 2: Technical  Uniquely Identifying VMs in vSphere Part 3: Enhanced Linked Mode &amp; Cross VC-vMotionHCX VM MigrationsWith HCX, VMs can easily migrate using various migration types (Cold, vMotion, Bulk, RAV) between vCenter Servers, whether on-prem vSphere (5.0-7.0) or cloud (VMware Cloud on AWS, Azure VMware Solutions, etc.). In this example, I have a source on-prem vCenter Server using HCX to migrate VMs to the destination vCenter Server in VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). Each VM name contains the migration type that will be used when its migrated to VMC with HCX. Before starting the migration, I grabbed the MoRef ID, InstanceUUID, and Tag for each VM as well as the source vCenter Server Name and its InstanceUUID.After the migrations completed successfully to the destination vCenter Server, we can see only one difference. All the VMs received a new MoRef ID, which is as expected since its managed per vCenter Server independently. The VM instanceUUID did not change, and will only change if a VM with the same UUID already exists on the destination vCenter Server.I was also able to pull the destination vCenter Server UUID, VM Name, and VM MoRef ID (HCX has this labeled as Id) using the Get-HCXVM cmdlet.HCX removes barriers! These are two distinct vSphere Single Sign-On (SSO) domains between on-prem and VMC, by combining VM instanceUUID with the vCenter Server unique identifier, you can identify VMs across multiple vCenter Servers. Another way to uniquely identify VMs in your environment is the use of vSphere tags. HCX will retain VM tag and category information from the source to the destination vCenter Server, see examples above. Now you can migrate successfully using HCX while understanding the impact on your VMs IDs and solutions that rely on them."

    "content": "Time is truly precious. With a blink of an eye, the years seem to be flying by, which makes it hard to believe in about another month marks four years at VMware for me. Its been a place with no shortage of learning and growing opportunities. I also feel incredibly blessed to have gotten the chance to work and collaborate with so many talented folks across the different business units within VMware.I spent the first three years working alongside a group of highly-skilled technical marketing architects in the Cloud Platform business unit (CPBU), part of the R&amp;D organization at VMware. My first focus area was vCenter Server, a product I was familiar with and used as a customer. I started out helping customers migrate from vCenter Server for Windows to the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) and covering the vCenter Server product overall. We did these migrations using various methods with no to minimal downtime, depending on the customer environment. Of course, this was before the release of the first official migration tool, vCenter Server 6.0 U2m, announced during VMworld 2016.Once the official vCenter Server migration tool was available, it made sense to also focus on vSphere lifecycle. The vCenter Server migration tool not only copied data (inventory and configuration by default) from one platform to another (vCenter Server for Windows to the VCSA), the process was also an upgrade. During this time, I worked on a series of content that included scenarios and later an ebook to help customers with their vSphere upgrades. Adam Eckerle and I also started to create workshops that we delivered at various VMUGs, VMworld US, and VMworld EMEA. These workshops became in such high demand; this led to the creation of a team under the vSphere Tech Marketing managed by Adam to specifically help with vSphere lifecycle.Shortly after, in addition to vCenter Server, I started working on VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) with a focus on hybridity and workload mobility. It was exciting being part of something like VMC from the beginning and getting the opportunity not only to influence the service but also work on new technology such as stretched clusters and hybrid linked mode. When it came to workload mobility, this was my first introduction to VMware HCX. An all-in-one platform that simplified workload mobility from any site, whether on-premises or cloud. Around this time, I had been in technical marketing for about 2 1/2 years and began to think about what I wanted to do next in my career.An opportunity to join the vSphere product management team presented itself working on driving the direction for vCenter Server lifecycle. Towards the end of 2018, I joined the PM team working on new functionality to help simplify vSphere lifecycle. While I can‚Äôt go into details, I would recommend watching this VMworld session presented by William Lam and myself and pay attention to the tech preview section. Having been in the PM role for a year, I learned so much about product development, delivery, and the number of meetings one could have on their calendar.Recently another opportunity presented itself, and I‚Äôm excited to announce that I have joined the VMware HCX team as Customer Zero. In this role, I‚Äôll be working closely with VMware HCX product management, engineering, and design on upcoming enhancements/functionality and also providing early feedback on usability and integrations, including on-premises, VMware Cloud on AWS, Google Cloud VMware Solution, and Azure VMware Solution. There is also the bonus of getting to work with a community member and food thief (guard your plate), Amy Lewis. I look forward to this new opportunity and sharing everything coming from the VMware HCX team."

    "content": "The embedded deployment is now VMware‚Äôs recommended deployment model for vCenter Server. This means all the required vCenter Server services are running on the same node. The release of vSphere 6.7 Update 1 introduces the convergence CLI tool. Customers with an existing external deployment can now change their topology to embedded. This deployment model also supports Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM). In the past, an external Platform Services Controller (PSC) was only needed for ELM. This is no longer the case with a simplified deployment model. While we are on the subject, let me clear up a few misconceptions I‚Äôve seen about embedded deployments.  The first misconception is an embedded deployment is a new deployment model. The embedded deployment model is not a new concept. It has been around since the initial VirtualCenter (2004) deployment. Over time VMware introduced new vCenter Server services including the PSC. With the addition of the PSC services, the embedded deployment model did not support ELM. Greenfield deployments on vSphere 6.5 and 6.7 support embedded deployments with ELM.  Another misconception is the maximums supported differs between the two deployment models. The embedded deployment supports the same vCenter Server maximums as the external deployment. This includes the same number of hosts, VMs, datastores, etc. there is no difference. Also, the embedded deployment supports a total of 15 vCenter Servers in a vSphere SSO domain.  A third misconception is with a PSC failure, an embedded deployment is likely to fail. A PSC failure, whether external or embedded, has the same result. Users will no longer be able to authenticate to the registered vCenter Server(s). The probability of PSC service failing when embedded is slim. Using vCenter Server High Availability (VCHA) is the preferred method for protecting against these types of failures. This also removes the overhead of using a load balancer for PSC high availability.Convergence Tool Overview[Update: The vCenter Server Appliance convergence tool is now also included in vCenter Server Update 2d. Same steps below apply]The convergence tool is only available on the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.7 Update 1 ISO. If you are familiar with the VCSA lifecycle JSON templates, the converge CLI tool is similar. There are two JSON templates, converge and decommission. In an external deployment, the PSC is running on a separate node. The necessary PSC RPMs are not installed on the registered vCenter Server. The converge tool will handle the installation of the PSC RPMs on the vCenter Server. There is no manual intervention required and it does not make any changes to the external PSC. After the installation of the PSC, it then registers with the vCenter Server.Next is the replication of the vSphere SSO data from the external PSC to the embedded PSC. The PSC replication partner is part of the converge tool JSON template, more on that in a bit. Only during convergence is replication from an external PSC to embedded PSC supported. Once the replication is complete, it time to decommission the external PSC. Let‚Äôs walk through the steps in more detail.Note: The convergence process can only run on one VCSA at a time.PrerequisitesThere are a few prerequisites and considerations before starting the convergence process:  The converge tool only supports the VCSA and PSC 6.7 Update 1. All nodes must be on 6.7 Update 1 before converting.  If you are currently running a Windows vCenter Server or PSC, you must first migrate to the appliance.  Before converting take a backup of your VCSA(s) and a least one of the PSCs in your vSphere SSO domain.  Know all other solutions (i.e. SRM, vROPS, NSX, etc.) using the PSC for authentication in your environment. They will need to be re-registered after the convergence completes and before decommissioning.  A machine on a routable network which can communicate with the VCSA and PSC will be used to run the convergence and decommission process.  It is recommended to change the DRS Automation Level to partially automated or manual and the Migration Threshold to conservative. There could be issues if the VCSA being converged is moved during the process.  If VCHA is enabled, it must be disabled prior to running the convergence process.  The converge process will handle PSC HA load balancers, make sure you point to the VIP in the JSON template.  All vSphere SSO data is migrated with the exception of local OS users.Note: If the VCSA File-Based backup is running using the scheduler the convergence process will fail. You must delete the scheduler prior to starting the convergence process. It can be re-enabled after the convergence process is complete.Convergence Steps  Backup all VCSAs and at least one PSC (multi-master) within your vSphere environment.  Mount the VCSA 6.7 Update 1 ISO on a machine with routable network access to the VCSA and PSC. The VCSA ISO supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.  Expand the vcsa-converge-cli directory and go to templates. Open the converge directory and copy the converge.json file to your local machine.      Open the local copy of the coverge.json file with your favorite editor. Fill out the JSON template with the required information. There are two sections to pay close attention to. The first is the ‚Äúad_domain_info‚Äù section. If your PSC is a member of an active directory domain, this section needs filled out. Otherwise, this entire section is not needed. The second section is the ‚Äúreplication‚Äù section of the JSON template. If there is only a single PSC with no replication partners, then this section is not needed. Use the vdcrepadmin command to check the replication agreements if you are unsure. Note: Use ./vcsa-util converge ‚Äì ‚Äìtemplate‚Äìhelp for additional help filling out the converge JSON template.     &lt;pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\"&gt;{     \"__version\": \"2.11.0\",     \"__comments\": \"Template for VCSA with external Platform Services Controller converge\",         \"vcenter\": {             \"description\": {                \"__comments\": [                     \"This section describes the vCenter appliance which you want to\",                     \"converge and the ESXi host on which the appliance is running. \"                 ]             },             \"managing_esxi_or_vc\": {                 \"hostname\": \"esx-02.cpbu.corp\",                 \"username\": \"root\",                 \"password\": \"P@ssw0rd\"             },             \"vc_appliance\": {                 \"hostname\": \"vcsa-01.cpbu.corp\",                 \"username\": \"administrator@vsphere.local\",                 \"password\": \"P@ssw0rd\",                 \"root_password\": \"P@ssw0rd\"             },             \"ad_domain_info\": {                 \"__comments\": [                     \"Important Note: This section is needed only when PSC (Platform Services Controller) appliance is joined to a domain.\",                     \"Remove this section if PSC appliance is not joined to a domain.\",                     \"Keeping this section without valid values results in JSON validation errors.\"                 ],                 \"domain_name\": \"cpbu.corp\",                 \"username\": \"emad\",                 \"password\": \"P@ssw0rd\",                 \"dns_ip\": \"192.168.13.50\"         },     \"replication\": {             \"description\": {                \"__comments\": [                \"Important Note: Make sure you provide the information in this section very carefully, as this changes the replication topology.\",                \"Refer to the documentation for complete details.

After completing the converge JSON template, make sure you save it.  Open a terminal window to the vcsa-util application path. Depending on the local operating system in use will determine the directory. In this example, I‚Äôm using macOS and using the vcsa-util under the mac directory.  Run ./vcsa-util converge ‚Äì ‚Äìhelp to get a list of the supported parameters.   To start the convergence process, use the correct parameters followed by the path of the converge JSON template you saved earlier. ```    ./vcsa-util converge --no-ssl-certificate-verification --backup-taken --verbose /Users/eyounis/Documents/converge.json ```    Once the convergence process begins, your VCSA will not be available until the process is complete.  After the convergence process has completed, verify the VCSA is now running with an embedded PSC. There are two ways to verify. The first is using the VMware Appliance Management on port 5480. Go to the Summary tab and verify the type is ‚ÄúvCenter Server with an embedded Platform Services Controller‚Äù. A second option is using the vSphere Client (HTML5). Look under the Administration menu for System Configuration and verify the type as above.  If there are any products using the PSC for authentication they will need to be re-registered. Re-register them with the embedded VCSA deployment before decommissioning the external PSC. Also, do not decommission an external PSC until all VCSAs registered have gone through the convergence process.Decommissioning Steps*Verify the steps above have been completed prior to starting the decommissioning process*  Expand the vcsa-converge-cli directory and go to templates. Open the decommission directory and copy the decommission_psc.json file to your local machine.  Open the local copy of the decommission_psc.json file with your favorite editor. Fill out the JSON template with the required information. If the default port of 443 was changed, make to enter the custom port that was used in the decommission template in the specified sections. ```    {     \"__comments\": \"Template for decommissioning PSC node with converge CLI tool.\",     \"__version\": \"2.11.0\",         \"psc\": {             \"description\": {                \"__comments\": [                    \"This section describes the PSC appliance which you want to\",                     \"decommission and the ESXi host on which the appliance is running. \"                 ]             },             \"managing_esxi_or_vc\": {                 \"hostname\": \"esx-02.cpbu.corp\",                 \"username\": \"root\",                 \"password\": \"P@ssw0rd\"             },             \"psc_appliance\": {                 \"hostname\": \"psc-01.cpbu.corp\",                 \"username\": \"administrator@vsphere.local\",                 \"password\": \"P@ssw0rd\",                 \"root_password\": \"P@ssw0rd\"             }         },         \"vcenter\": {             \"description\": {                \"__comments\": [                     \"This section describes the embedded vCenter appliance which is in \",                     \"replication with the provided PSC\"                 ]             },             \"managing_esxi_or_vc\": {                 \"hostname\": \"esx-02.cpbu.corp\",                 \"username\": \"root\",                 \"password\": \"P@ssw0rd\"             },             \"vc_appliance\": {                 \"hostname\": \"vcsa-01.cpbu.corp\",                 \"username\": \"administrator@vsphere.local\",                 \"password\": \"P@ssw0rd\",                 \"root_password\": \"P@ssw0rd\"             }         } } ```    After completing the decommission JSON template, save it.  Open a terminal window to the vcsa-util application path, same steps as above.  Run ./vcsa-util decommission ‚Äì ‚Äìhelp to get a list of the supported parameters.  To start the decommission process, use the correct parameters followed by the path of the decommission JSON template you saved earlier. ```    ./vcsa-util decommission --no-ssl-certificate-verification --verbose /Users/eyounis/Documents/decommission_psc.json ```    The decommissioning process will begin removing the external PSC from the vSphere SSO domain. There are validations included to ensure there are no registered VCSAs to the external PSC being decommissioned. If any are found, the decommissioning process will fail. SummaryGreat job by the vCenter Server engineering team for all their hard work on this tool. As stated earlier VMware‚Äôs recommended deployment model going forward is embedded. I would say the writing is on the wall for the external deployment now that the convergence tool is available. The next blog post will cover a few topology convergence examples. Happy converting üôÇ"

    "content": "Today I‚Äôm happy to announce vSphere 6.7 Update 1 is now generally available. This release includes a single vSphere Client to manage them all. I‚Äôm referring to the HTML5 based vSphere Client, now fully featured. Also, included in this release are the necessary tools for convergence and repointing. An external Platform Services Controller (PSC) for enhanced linked mode is a thing of the past. Customers can now convert to a simplified embedded deployment supporting the same functionality.The vSphere SSO domain also is receiving more flexibility with support for embedded repointing. Now a single embedded deployment can move to another vSphere SSO domain. Another feature with enhancements in vSphere 6.7 Update 1 is Content Library. It now supports native vCenter Server templates (.vmtx) and Open Virtual Appliance (OVA). Of course, there are more new features and enhancements in this release. Without further ado, here is what‚Äôs new in vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1.vSphere ClientThe wait is finally over! We now have a fully featured vSphere client in vSphere 6.7 Update 1. Delivering a fully featured client to customers was only part of the process. The vSphere team also wanted to optimize the vSphere Client‚Äôs performance and workflows. Ensuring the best customer experience possible. This release includes smart porting over and completing the remaining features which included:  vCenter High Availability (VCHA)  Auto Deploy  Host Profiles  vSphere Update Manager  Network Topology Diagrams  Performance Charts  Improved Searching  Dark Theme  more‚Ä¶vSphere Client Youtube PlaylistThere are two features I want to highlight from the vSphere Client in vSphere 6.7 Update 1. The first is the improved searching capabilities. Customers can now search objects with a string and filter based attributes. These attributes include Tags, Custom Attributes, and VM power state to name a few. For common searches, there is also an option to save the search for future usage.The second feature I want to highlight is considered one of the top feature requests. The vSphere team has been listening and now the dark theme option is available. Now customers can switch between the traditional light theme to the new dark theme in a single click. When switching to dark theme a blue information banner appears at the top of the screen. In this release dark theme supports vSphere features and plugins. Keep in mind other features and plugins may not render well until the necessary changes are in place. Glad the vSphere team was able to get this nice surprise in this release.Convergence ToolvCenter Server is going back to its roots of a simplified architecture. vSphere 6.0 introduced us to a new vCenter Server service called the PSC. The role of the PSC is to manage the following vSphere SSO domain components:  Authentication  Licensing  Tags &amp; Categories  Global Permissions  Custom Roles  CertificatesThe PSC has two deployment models, embedded and external. The only reason to use an external PSC at the time was for Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM). Otherwise, use the embedded deployment model for simplicity. Starting with vSphere 6.7 and 6.5 Update 2 the embedded deployment model supports ELM, but only for greenfield deployments. Until now customers who deployed an external PSC for ELM had no way to change their topology to an embedded PSC. vSphere 6.7 Update 1 introduces a new CLI tool to converge a PSC deployment from external to embedded.The convergence tool is available in a directory called ‚ÄúVCSA-Converge-CLI‚Äù on the VCSA 6.7 Update 1 ISO. Before using the convergence tool there are two important prerequisites. First, a vSphere environment must be running vSphere 6.7 Update 1. This includes all the external PSCs and vCenter Servers in the vSphere SSO domains. Second, the convergence tool does not support Windows PSCs or vCenters Servers. Meaning migrate to the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) you should!There are two JSON template options, converge and decommission. We start by using the converge JSON which will install the necessary PSC RPMs on the external VCSA. After the PSC service gets registered on the external VCSA, its now converted to embedded. But we‚Äôre not done, we still need to replicate the vSphere SSO data between the external PSC and the embedded PSC. This is actually taken care of as part of the JSON template and requires no manual intervention. The final step is to decommission the external PSC using the decommission JSON template. Stay tuned, there will be a more detailed blog post with examples coming soon.Note: Embedded PSC is the recommended deployment model for vCenter Server.Embedded Domain RepointDomain repoint is a feature available in vSphere 6.7 using the cmsso-util CLI command. Customers can repoint an external vCenter Server across a vSphere SSO domain. New in vSphere 6.7 Update 1 is support for embedded deployment domain repoint. Remember the time you selected a new vSphere SSO domain instead of an existing? Leaving you with several single embedded deployment instances. With domain repoint we can now join them to a single vSphere SSO domain. Other use cases are merges or acquisitions, no longer requiring a setup of a new vSphere SSO domain.vCenter High AvailabilityvCenter Server native high availability was first introduced in vSphere 6.5. This is an active/passive solution designed to protect against application failure. In this case, it‚Äôs protecting the vCenter Server application. In vSphere 6.7 Update 1 vCenter High Availability is an example of a smart port workflow. There is no longer two workflows of basic and advanced, now only one workflow. The new workflow is a three-step configuration:  vSphere SSO credentials for either management vCenter Server or management credentials  Resource settings for the Passive and Witness nodes including compute, storage, and network  IP Settings for the Passive and Witness nodesAlso included is auto-creation of the Active node clones to create the Passive and Witness nodes. A prerequisite for auto clone provisioning is entering the vSphere SSO domain credentials. Regardless of its self-managed or managed by another vCenter Server. Other enhancements including auto-detection of VCHA during an upgrade. Customers no longer have to destroy a VCHA configuration before upgrading to vSphere 6.7 U1. The upgrade wizard is aware of the configuration and will handle it as part of the upgrade process. We‚Äôll save the best for last, REST APIs for VCHA are also included in the VCSA 6.7 Update 1 API Explorer.Content LibraryThis feature has been around since vSphere 6.0 and is one of my favorites. As a customer, I had to manage several images, scripts, OVAs, and templates for several remote sites. Having to maintain and update the same content in several locations can be a nightmare. Content Library is a native vCenter Server service which solves this problem. It uses the subscriber/publisher model to distribute content. There are two deployment models when using Content Library:  Single vCenter Server managing several sites          Centralized managed content      Uses WAN to sync content, requires publishing vCenter Server to be available      Content stored on a datastore at the remote sites      When provisioning content at the remote sites, traffic is kept local        Multi vCenter Server          Centralized managed content      Uses WAN to sync content      Can sustain publishing vCenter Server failure, remote locations continue to operate      Content stored on a datastore at the remote sites      When provisioning content at the remote sites, traffic is kept local      This release Content Library now supports two more new file formats. This functionality is already available to VMware Cloud on AWS customers. Now it‚Äôs making its way to on-premises vSphere customers in vSphere 6.7 Update 1. Customers can now manage their templates on the local vCenter Server Content Library. Replication of template files to other subscriber Content Libraries is not available in this release. The other new supported format is Open Virtual Appliance (OVA). When importing an OVA file format in a Content Library, its content is first extracted. This allows Content Library to validate the OVA manifest and certificate. After the validation process is complete, it creates an OVF item for deployment. Give Content Library a try in your environment and let us know your thoughts.vSphere HealthThis is a new feature with huge potential. When deploying your vCenter Server there is an option to enable CEIP. It stands for Customer experience improvement program. When enabled data gets sent to VMware‚Äôs analytics cloud, customer workload data is not part of the data collected. This is all anonymous, data is secure and housed in VMware‚Äôs data centers. VMware uses this telemetry data to help improve features and customer experience. Now when enabled this functionality provides even more value to the customers. It provides an assessment of the vSphere environment and returns KBs on how to solve the problem at hand. For example, the warning you get when you only have a single management network for your ESXi hosts. We detect and provide alarms for both existing and potential problems. This helps in protecting customer environments from future problems.Keep in mind this is a new service and will not have all health checks day one. The good news is this services independent of the vSphere release cycle. It features an out-of-band delivery infrastructure. If you are running vSphere 6.7 you also have the same capabilities as well. The goal here is overtime this service will become more proactive to ensure you have a healthy vSphere environment. If you haven‚Äôt enabled CEIP during your vSphere deployment, it‚Äôs easy enough to enable and gain the new benefits this service has to offer.Appliance ManagementThe appliance management interface (VAMI) continues to gain new functionality with every release. vSphere 6.7 Update 1 continues to add-on from what vSphere 6.5 started. In this release, there is a new tab called ‚ÄúFirewall‚Äù. Now customers can manage firewall rules on the VCSA from the VAMI. This was previously only available using the VAMI APIs.Another new feature which isn‚Äôt obvious is the ability to login VAMI with a local SSO user account. This release supports local vSphere SSO users who are members of the ‚ÄúSytemConfiguration.Administrators group. Also, members of the ‚ÄúSystemonfiguration.BashShellAdministrators‚Äù can use their SSO account to log in the VCSA bash shell. This makes it easier from a security perspective to track who logged in and what they did.SummaryAs you can see vSphere 6.7 Update 1 is full of new features and enhancements for vCenter Server. We will go into more details on these new vCenter Server features and enhancements in future posts. Also, if you have any feedback on the new features or enhancements, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out."

    "content": "I recently attended a cloud migration session. The first thing the speaker said was ‚Äúwe want you to migrate to the Cloud, but we don‚Äôt care how you do it‚Äù. There was no discussion of service level agreements (SLA), dependencies, or migration options, only get to the cloud! Before migrating any workload, it‚Äôs important to have a good understanding of its SLAs, dependencies, and data. Once you have a good grasp of the workload, the next step is selecting the right migration tool or type. The following is in no particular order, but here are a few things to consider before starting a migration:  How will the workloads get migrated?  Does the migration type meet the SLA of the workloads?  What is the impact of the migration to the workloads (downtime)?  Are there any required changes pre and post-migration?  Is the proper networking (secure) in place and is there enough bandwidth?  Was a discovery of the environment done, including mapping of dependencies?As you start to ask these questions more will come up. The point is you can‚Äôt migrate to the Cloud without understanding the impact. The first blog post of this series was an overview of Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX). This post will focus on the available migration types HCX offers.Migration TypesHCX supports four different migration types:  Cold Migration ‚Äì offline  vMotion (live) ‚Äì no downtime  Bulk Migration ‚Äì low downtime  Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication ‚Äì no downtimeCold migration and vMotion should be familiar to those using the built-in vSphere mobility options. Bulk Migration and Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication are new options and only available with HCX. Let‚Äôs take a look at how each option works and what is the impact to the workloads.Cloud Motion with vSphere ReplicationThe new kid on the block announced during the VMworld 2018 US keynote. This new option provides zero downtime for workload mobility from source to destination. First, the workload disk(s) (VMDK) get replicated to the destination site. The replication is handled using the HCX built-in vSphere replication. This process is dependent on the amount of data and available network bandwidth. Once the data sync is complete the HCX switchover initiates a vMotion. The vMotion migrates the workload to the destination site and synchronizes only the remaining data (delta) and workload memory state. There is an option to schedule a maintenance window for the vMotion data sync switchover otherwise, it happens immediately.When using the scheduling option, there are a few things to be aware of. First, the switchover can be re-scheduled any time prior to the actual scheduled time. Secondly, if the initial vSphere Replication data sync has not completed prior to the scheduled window, the workload(s) being migrated will fail. In this case, these workload migrations must be restarted in their entirety. Finally, if the vSphere Replication data sync has completed prior to the scheduled switchover window, HCX will continue to sync delta information to keep the migrated data as current as possible prior to the vMotion switchover. The vMotion switchover happens in a serialized fashion, only one at a time. Today Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication is uni-directional from on-premises to VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). This is due to HCX leveraging changes in the newer vSphere platform available in VMC. As a result, only VMware Cloud on AWS supports Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication today. Stay tuned, more will be coming for on-premises to on-premises migrations using Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication.Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication Notes  Uni-directional from on-premises to VMware Cloud on AWS (see details above)  Supports source vSphere (vCenter Server / ESXi) versions 5.5 and above  Cross-version migration from vSphere 5.5 to the current release of 6.7 Update 1  Currently no support for on-premises to on-premises migrations  Concurrent migrations = 100 (initial data sync using vSphere Replication)Bulk MigrationBulk Migration creates a new virtual machine on the destination site. This can either be on-premises or VMC and retains the workload UUID. Then it uses vSphere Replication to copy a snapshot of the workload from source to destination site while the workload is still powered on. In this case, a snapshot is a point of the time of the workload disk state, but not a traditional vSphere snapshot. The Bulk Migration is managed by the HCX interconnect cloud gateway proxy. We‚Äôll go into more details about the HCX interconnect cloud gateway in the deployment post. During the data sync, there is no interruption to the workloads. The data sync is dependent on the amount of data and available bandwidth. There is an option to schedule a maintenance window for the switchover (similar to the schedule options described in the Cloud Motion section above) otherwise, the switchover happens immediately. Once the initial data sync completes, a switchover takes place (unless scheduled). The source site workloads are quiesced and shut down leveraging VMware Tools. If VMware Tools is not available, HCX will prompt you to force power off the workload(s) to initiate the switchover. During the switchover process, a delta sync occurs based on changed block tracking (CBT) to sync the changes since the original snapshot. The workloads on the destination site will begin to power on once the data sync is complete (including delta data changes). There are checks in place to ensure resources are available to power on the workloads. If a destination workload cannot power on due to resources, the source workload will get powered back on.Unlike cold migration, the downtime incurred after the bulk migration cut over is low. The HCX manager renames the original source workloads by appending a binary timestamp. A migrated VMs folder gets created in the VM and templates view. Finally, the original source workloads get placed in the migrated VMs folder. This also provides an option for easy rollback and quick data seeding since bulk migration supports reverse migrations. One thing worth mentioning is HCX has built-in network resiliency and will pick up where it left off during a data sync if there is any network interruption. On the flip side, if there is an issue powering on workloads on the destination site or missed scheduling a cut over, the entire data sync process will need to be started over. This technology allows a workload migration between different chipset versions (e.g. Sandy Bridge to Skylake) and across different CPU families (e.g. AMD to Intel).Bulk Migration Notes  Automatic update of VM compatibility (hardware) version and VMware Tools available during the switchover  Supports vCenter Server 5.1 and above / ESXi 5.0 and above  Cross-version migration from vSphere 5.0 / 5.1 to the current release of 6.7 Update 1  Concurrent migrations = 100  Bi-directional migration (reverse HCX option)vMotion ‚ÄúLive Migration‚ÄùHCX supports the vMotion we know and love today. The workloads are migrated live with no downtime similar to Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication. vMotion should not be used to migrate hundreds of workloads or workloads with large amounts of data. Instead, use Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication or Bulk Migration. Usually, a vMotion network needs to be configured and routed to the target vSphere host, in this case, the vMotion traffic is handled by the HCX Interconnect cloud gateway for cross-cloud vMotion. vMotion through HCX encapsulates and encrypts all traffic from source to destination removing network complexity of routing to cloud. The vMotion captures workload:  Active Memory  Execution State  IP Address  MAC addressHCX has a built-in option to retain the workloads MAC address. If this option is not checked, the workloads will have a different MAC on the destination site. Workloads must be at compatibility (hardware) version 9 or greater and 100 Mbps or above of bandwidth must be available. With vMotion and bi-directional migration, it‚Äôs important to consider Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC). The good news here is HCX also handles EVC. The workloads can be migrated seamlessly and once rebooted will inherit the CPU features from the target cluster. This allows a cross-cloud vMotion between different chipset versions (e.g. Sandy Bridge to Skylake) but within the same CPU family (e.g. Intel). Also, an important thing to note is vMotion is done in a serialized manner. Only one vMotion occurs at a time and queues the remaining workloads until the current vMotion is complete.vMotion Notes  Does not support disk sizes over 2TB and shared VMDK files  Attached virtual media or ISOs can be removed prior using the HCX global option  Does not support compatibility (hardware) version 8 or below  Supports vSphere ESXi Host versions 5.5 and above  Cross-version migration from vSphere 5.5 to the current release of 6.7 Update 1  Bi-directional migration (reverse HCX option)Cold MigrationAs the name states, a cold migration occurs when a workload is offline. CPU compatibility checks do not apply during a cold migration. During a cold migration, VMware‚Äôs Network File Copy (NFC) protocol is used to transfer the workloads from source to destination which includes:  Configuration files including BIOS settings (NVRAM)  Disks associated with the workload  Log filesUsually, cold migration traffic takes place over the host management network. This traffic type is known as provisioning traffic. Provisioning traffic is not encrypted but uses run-length encoding. Run-length encoding is a simple form of lossless data compression. In the case of HCX, cold migration traffic will get encrypted using Suite B encryption. It leverages the same host management network to migrate the data through the HCX vMotion proxy. HCX only displays the cold migration option if the selected workload is not powered on. Although HCX provides the option to multi-select it is still limited. vCenter Server only handles 8 concurrent vMotions (cold and live) at a time. It places the remaining selected workloads in a queue until ready to migrate.Cold Migration Notes  If transferring large amounts of data consider using Bulk Migration or Cloud Motion  vCenter Server templates are good candidates  Supports vSphere ESXi Host versions 5.5 and above  Cross-version migration from vSphere 5.5 to the current release of 6.7 Update 1  Bi-directional migration (reverse HCX option)SummaryHCX offers customers several different workload mobility options covering different SLAs and requirements. No reconfiguration of the source or destination sites is necessary to get started. The platform offers built-in encryption, WAN optimization, and cross-version migration through the HCX interconnects. The HCX service is evolving at a rapid rate, the team is making improvements and adding new functionality on almost a monthly basis. Next, we‚Äôll be diving into how to deploy and configure HCX in VMware Cloud on AWS and on-premises."

    "content": "Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) is an all in one solution for workload mobility. Customers can freely move workloads between multiple on-premises environments as well as VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). During the VMworld US 2018 day 1 keynote there were several demos shown, one included a data center evacuation using HCX (51:57). The data center evacuation was using a new HCX migration type called Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication. I‚Äôll cover the HCX migration types in a later post. The workloads were being migrated from an on-premises data center to VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). The big deal here is the impact during the migration to the users was NONE, ZIP, ZERO downtime. And there was also no replatforming of the workloads or applications.Think about what‚Äôs usually involved when migrating workloads from one location to another. The network is at the top of the list, ensuring adequate bandwidth and routing is in place. Not only from data center to data center or data center to cloud, but also across regions and remote sites. Validating vSphere version compatibility between the source and destination is also important. Other workload migration considerations could include:  Moving across different vSphere SSO domains independent of enhanced linked mode  Mapping workload dependencies  Older hardware preventing from upgrading to vSphere 6.x  Bi-directional migrations independent of vSphere SSO domains, vSphere versions, hardware, or networks  Validation of resources (compute and storage) on the destination side  SLA and downtime involved  Mobility options correlating to SLAs (downtime, low downtime, no downtime)  No replatforming of the workloads or applications including no changes to IP or MAC Addresses, VM UUID, certsThese are only a few examples of workload migration considerations, but you get the point. I‚Äôve been working with the HCX team for the past few months and I have to say it‚Äôs definitely great technology. They have built-in the necessary tooling within the product and removed several boundaries.HCX OverviewHCX is the swiss army knife of workload mobility. It abstracts and removes the boundaries of underlying infrastructure focusing on the workloads. A HCX vMotion, for example, requires no direct connectivity to ESXi hosts in either direction compared to a vSphere vMotion. All HCX vMotion traffic gets managed through the HCX vMotion Proxy at each location. The HCX vMotion Proxy resembles an ESXi host within the vCenter Server inventory. It‚Äôs deployed at the data center level by default, no intervention is necessary. One thing to mention is the HCX vMotion proxy gets added to the vCenter Server host count by default. The HCX team is aware and will be changing this in the future, but this has no impact on your vSphere licensing.Another boundary HCX removes is it supports several versions of vSphere going back to vSphere 5.0 to the most current release of vSphere 6.7 Update 1. This provides flexibility in moving workloads across vSphere versions, on-premises locations, and vSphere SSO domains. For on-premises to on-premises migrations, a NSX Hybrid Connect license is required per HCX site pairing. We will cover site pairing in the configuration blog post. Migrating workloads from on-premises to VMC does not require a separate HCX license. By default when deploying a VMC SDDC HCX is included as an add-on and is enabled by default. From the VMC add-ons tab, all that is required is clicking open Hybrid Cloud Extension and then deploy HCX. The deployment of HCX is completely automated within the VMC SDDC.In order to start migrating workloads, network connectivity between the source and destination needs to be in place. The good news is it‚Äôs all built-in to the product. HCX has WAN optimization, deduplication, and compression to increase efficiency while decreasing the time it takes to perform migrations. The minimum network bandwidth required to migrate workloads with HCX is 100 Mbps. HCX can leverage your internet connection as well as direct connect. The established network tunnel is secured using suite B encryption. The on-premises workloads being migrated with no downtime will need to reside on a vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS). It also supports a 3rd party switch in the Nexus 1000v. Cold and bulk HCX migration types are currently the only two options which support the use of a vSphere standard switch but implies downtime for the workload (The HCX team is working on adding support for the vSphere standard switch for other migration types). To minimize migration downtime, HCX has a single click option to extend on-premises networks (L2 stretch) to other on-premises sites or VMware Cloud on AWS. Once the workloads have been migrated there is also an option to migrate the extended network, if you choose. Other built-in functionality includes:  Native scheduler for migrations  Per-VM EVC  Upgrade VM Tools / Compatibility (hardware)  Retain mac address  Remove snapshots  Force Unmount ISO images  Bi-directional migration supportSummaryHCX provides enhanced functionality on top of the built-in vSphere VM mobility options. Customers can now use HCX to migrate workloads seamlessly from on-premises to other paired on-premises sites (multisite) and VMware Cloud on AWS. Workload mobility can also help with hardware refreshes as well as upgrading from unsupported vSphere 5.x version. The next post will cover the different migration options available within HCX, followed by how to setup and configure the product."

    "content": "VMware Cloud on AWS includes resiliency at different layers. We are all familiar with vSphere HA protecting against ESXi host failures. With VMware Cloud on AWS, ESXi hosts reside in an AWS availability zone and are protected by vSphere HA. What about protection for the availability zone the ESXi hosts reside in? While an AWS availability zone failure is a rare occurrence, customers should know they also are protected at this layer as well. A new feature called Stretched Clusters for VMware Cloud on AWS is designed to protect against an AWS availability zone failure. Now applications can span multiple AWS availability zones within a VMware Cloud on AWS cluster. If an application instance fails the second instance in another availability zone can take over. This, of course, depends on if the application includes this level of availability. Let‚Äôs take a look at the Stretched Clusters feature.Infrastructure ConfigurationThe Stretched Clusters feature deploys a single SDDC across two AWS availability zones. This option is only available during the SDDC creation steps under SDDC properties. When enabled the default number of ESXi hosts supported in a Stretched Cluster is six. Additional hosts can be added later but must to be done in pairs across AWS availability zones.The Stretched Clusters feature requires an AWS VPC with two subnets, one subnet per availability zone. The subnets determine an ESXi host placement between the two availability zones. As an SDDC is deploying, it provisions three hosts in each AWS availability zone and creates a vSAN stretch cluster across the two availability zones. The vSAN stretched cluster allows synchronous writes across the two availability zones. A vSAN witness node appliance, which looks like an ESXi host, will automatically be provisioned. It resides outside the SDDC cluster and in a third AWS availability zone. The vSAN witness node appliance is required in case network communication is lost, assisting to avoid split brain for virtual machines across AWS availability zones. Logical networks are also extended using NSX to support workload mobility across the two AWS availability zones.Workload ManagementOnce a stretched clusters SDDC is available, go to the summary tab and view the VMware Cloud on AWS console. The console displays the capacity and usage of the SDDC for the two AWS availability zones.Now let‚Äôs login to vCenter Server. Here the SDDC will appear as a single logic datacenter with two fault domains. The ESXi hosts in the cluster span the two AWS availability zones. Customers can view which availability zone each host resides in from its summary tab. The fault domains listed correlate to the given AWS availability zone name. For a single view of all the ESXi hosts in a cluster and their fault domain, select the cluster and go to the Hosts tab. Within the Hosts tab, add the fault domain column.When provisioning virtual machines, customers have options when deploying to an availability zone. The first option is auto placement. This occurs at the cluster level, where DRS will handle the placement of the workload. A more granular option is selecting a host in an availability zone to deploy virtual machines to. DRS will honor the virtual machine availability zone placement as a sticky rule. It will only move the virtual machine in case of a failure. vSphere HA will attempt to honor this placement decision if possible. An availability zone failure will have the same behavior as a vSphere HA event. All virtual machines in the failed availability zone will get restarted in another availability zone. vSphere HA restart priority is also taken into account:  vCenter Server has the highest restart priority. Other management virtual machines have a high restart priority  Virtual machines migrated (cold or live) from on-premises will keep their restart priority  New Virtual Machines created on a stretched cluster will restart after other higher priority virtual machinesCustomers now have full resiliency for their mission-critical applications across AWS availability zones with zero RPO due to synchronous replication built in natively in their Cloud SDDC. You can use the VMware Hands-On Labs to test drive VMware Cloud on AWS and this new product walkthrough and video to get familiar with the Stretched Clusters feature. Glenn Sizemore will also have a blog post coming with more details on the how storage works with Stretched Clusters, stay tuned."

    "content": "With the release of vSphere 6.7 and 6.5 U2 comes architectural changes for vCenter Server. vCenter Server is going back to its roots of a simplified deployment model. vCenter Server used to be a single node deployment. The only debate was about its availability. Over time the architecture of vCenter Server has changed introducing a distributed deployment model. Core services like inventory, web client, SSO, and vCenter could run on separate nodes. vCenter Server had the potential of becoming six nodes in this model when adding the VCDB and VUM. The distributed deployment model became too complex for management, maintenance, and upgrades.To simplify the distributed model, VMware introduced the Platform Services Controller (PSC). The role of the PSC is to manage authentication, licensing, tags &amp; categories, global permissions, and custom roles. It is also the certificate authority for the vSphere SSO domain. The PSC is a vCenter Server service which manages the components mentioned above. While the PSC is an improvement over the original SSO introduced in 5.1 and 5.5 it also added complexity. So began another debate of external versus embedded deployments. The reality comes down to enhanced linked mode. At the time (6.0 ‚Äì 6.5 U1) only external deployments supported enhanced linked mode and external as a standalone. Now (6.5 U2 ‚Äì 6.7) supports enhanced linked mode for embedded deployments. Now we are back to a more simplified deployment model and questions about how to transition.Figure above represents the evolution of vCenter Server deployments. VMware has recognized the complexities involved in vCenter Server deployments and is putting efforts into getting back to a simpler deployment model allowing administrators can focus more on day-2 operations.PSC BasicsBefore we actually get into architecture it‚Äôs important to understand the basics. This is especially important when it comes to discussing availability. Let‚Äôs start with what happens when the PSC service is not available. We cannot authenticate (login) to vCenter Server, doesn‚Äôt matter if the PSC is embedded or external. Not only vCenter Server but other VMware products using the PSC for authentication will be affected. Examples are NSX, SRM, and vROPS to name a few. The next time you enter your credentials in the vSphere Client, hit enter, and watch the browser URL. You‚Äôll see the URL change from vCenter Server‚Äôs FQDN to the PSC FQDN and back. For external deployments with several PSCs, it means losing a replication partner. This only affects authentication to any vCenter Server registered with the unavailable PSC. Workloads are still running, but the ability to login and centrally manage is not available. Now that you know the impact, think about who does this impact inside your organization. We‚Äôll come back this during the availability discussion in this series.It‚Äôs also important to understand the relationship between PSC and vCenter Server. An embedded PSC is only registered to the vCenter Server on the same node. An external PSC has a one-to-many relationship with vCenter Server.  vSphere 6.0 ‚Äì a single external PSC can have up to 10 vCenter Servers registered  vSphere 6.5 and 6.7 ‚Äì a single external PSC can have up to 15 vCenter Servers registered  vSphere 6.0 ‚Äì supports up to 8 external PSCs within a vSphere SSO domain  vSphere 6.5 and 6.7 ‚Äì supports up to 10 external PSCs within a vSphere SSO domainOne of the vSphere maximums you don‚Äôt see is one for sites. A site is nothing more than a logic boundary and a way to group PSCs. You can have as many sites as you want as long as it does not exceed the number of supported PSCs in a vSphere SSO domain. Starting with vSphere 6.7 sites are not required for new deployments. During upgrades and migrations, sites will remain. Adding a new PSC to an upgraded or migrated environment will prompt for site information. External deployments can repoint vCenter Servers to any PSC in a vSphere SSO domain. Also now in vSphere 6.7 across different vSphere SSO domains. Currently, embedded deployments cannot repoint across different vSphere SSO domains. Sites are one less boundary to worry about going forward. The recommendation is to keep the default for new deployments from the GUI or CLI.Example 1: vSphere 6.7 embedded deployment with enhanced linked mode in a vSphere SSO domain. The PSC is running as a vCenter Server service in this example and everything within the vSphere SSO domain is considered a single default site.Example 2: vSphere 6.7 external deployment with enhanced linked mode in a vSphere SSO domain. Everything within the vSphere SSO domain is considered a single default site.The key thing to remember is the PSC is multi-master. Meaning there is no difference between the first one or the last one in the vSphere SSO domain. The PSCs replicate to each other every 30 seconds; this means if a PSC is unavailable the same data is available on its replication partners. To mitigate data loss, create a replication agreement between the bookends. This is referring to the first and last PSC in a vSphere SSO domain, creating a ring. The ring is creating a second data path in case you lose a data path. I‚Äôve have seen several blog posts refer to the creating the ring as a requirement which is not true. The ring is a recommendation but not a requirement. Outside of the ring, creating more PSC replication agreements can cause unnecessary overhead. Keep it simple!Example 3: An additional replication agreement created using vdcrepadmin from the last PSC to the first PSC (bookends) in the vSphere SSO domain, providing a secondary data path.vCenter Server BasicsMost of the architecture discussions revolve around the vSphere SSO domain. There are some core concepts and considerations for vCenter Server as well. I pose the same question, but now what happens when the PSC is available but vCenter Server is not? The impact is you‚Äôve lost management visibility and can not make any changes. Existing workloads are not affected by the outage. There are other implications to a vCenter Server outage. Some solutions communicating to vCenter Server as an endpoint will also lose access. For example, vROPS will not be able to collect metrics. Your backup window may also be affected. There are other products are resilient and not dependent on vCenter Server being available. Take vSAN for example, it is not dependent on vCenter and will continue to function. The VMware ecosystem has grown over the years and it‚Äôs important to know the impact of each solution within your environment when vCenter Server is not available.We discussed the relationship between PSC to vCenter Server as one-to-many, but vCenter Server to PSC is 1:1. A vCenter Server can only be registered to a single PSC at a time.  vSphere 6.0 ‚Äì supports 10 external vCenter Server deployments in enhanced linked mode  vSphere 6.5 &amp; 6.7 ‚Äì supports 15 external vCenter Server deployments in enhanced linked mode  vSphere 6.7 ‚Äì supports 15 embedded deployments in enhanced linked mode  vSphere 6.5 U2 ‚Äì supports 15 embedded deployments in enhanced linked modeIn regards to physical location placement, VMware currently does not have any documented latency numbers. The recommendation is up to 100ms in a multisite configuration. This is the same for the new embedded with enhanced linked mode deployment. For external deployments at least one local PSC per site. Remember communication is continuous between vCenter Server and PSC. Stay tuned as we are trying to get official latency numbers published.vCenter Server licensing comes up quite a bit. A standard vCenter Server license includes:  All PSCs when in an external deployment.  Native vCenter Server high availability (VCHA)  File-Based Backup / Restore  Other advanced vCenter Server featuresvCenter Server also has a foundation version. It has limitations on available features and functionality compared to the standard version.There are many questions about the new vCenter Server architecture 6.7, but I felt it was important to go basics. Over the next few posts, I‚Äôll go into more details on both the embedded and external deployment models."

    "content": "Today VMware launched vSphere 6.7 and there are lots of new enhancements in this release. But first the news. This is the final release for both vCenter Server for Windows and the vSphere Web Client (flash). The vCenter Server path is set and has been for a while with the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). The vSphere Client (HTLM5) is getting close to feature complete in this release.There are some considerations around upgrades for this release. First, I can‚Äôt stress it enough read the release notes, they are your friend. vSphere 6.7 will only support upgrades and migrations from vSphere 6.0 or 6.5. What does this mean for vSphere 5.5? In short a vSphere 5.5 to 6.7 upgrade or migration is multi-step. Also, a vCenter Server 6.0 or 6.5 managing ESXi 5.5 hosts will also be a multi-step upgrade. In this case, the ESXi 5.5 hosts will need to be upgraded to at least vSphere 6.0 before upgrading the vCenter Server. OK on to the What‚Äôs new with vCenter Server Appliance 6.7.vCenter Server Appliance 6.7 CLI InstallervSphere 6.7 has improvements in several areas of the vCenter Server appliance. Let‚Äôs start with the CLI installer. For the most part, the vCenter Server Appliance 6.7 ISO is the same compared to 6.5 with one exception. There is now a templates schemas directory under the CLI installer directory. The schemas are meant as a data type guide for the JSON templates. This is actually a good segway to the VCSA CLI installer.If you haven‚Äôt use the CLI installer, you‚Äôre missing out. This release introduces a new enhancement called batch operations. Prior we had to run each JSON individual and in the correct sequence manually. With batch operations, we can now drop several JSON files in a single directory and the CLI installer will handle the deployment and sequence. We are still responsible for making sure the JSON templates correctly filled out. Also ensuring the correct replication agreements are in place. Then sit back and watch the magic happen. The Batch operations also handles the VCSA lifecycle of install, upgrade, and migrate üôÇCMSSO-Util Repointing ToolsThere are a couple of updates to the cmsso-util for repointing. Keep in mind both of these updates are only for external deployments. The first is not actually new but is making a return. If you said repoint across sites, you are correct. Repointing is supported within a site and across sites in vSphere 6.7.The second repointing update is new in vSphere 6.7. Now you can repoint your vCenter Server across a vSphere SSO domain. Think vSphere SSO domain consolidation! Domain repoint comes with a pre-check option which generates any discrepancies before repointing. These discrepancies are logged in a JSON file to be verified and corrected prior to repointing. If the pre-check option is not used the opportunity to resolve any discrepancies is not available. Therefore, it highly recommended to use it. The domain repoint feature migrates licenses, tags, categories, and permissions from one PSC to another.vSphere Appliance Management Interface (VAMI)The vSphere Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) has received a significant amount of improvement. VAMI is becoming the VCSA tool for monitoring and out of band troubleshooting. Now sporting the new Clarity theme for a more unified look across the VMware portfolio. There are several new tabs and enhancements in the VCSA 6.7 VAMI, these include:  Monitoring ‚Äì visibility to CPU, memory, network, and database utilization.            A new addition called disks is now available under the monitoring tab. Here we can see all the disk partitions for the VCSA, space available and utilization.                  Improved alerting in the vSphere Client based on triggered events.                      Services ‚Äì previously in the vSphere Web Client and now in VAMI for out of band troubleshooting. All the services that make up the VCSA, their startup type, health, and state are visible here. We are also given the option to start, stop, and restart services if needed.  Syslog ‚Äì increased the supported number of syslog forwards to three. Prior, vSphere 6.5 only supported forwarding to only one.  Update ‚Äì there is now more flexibility in selecting patches and updates. Information about each patch or update is available such as type, severity, and if a reboot is necessary.            Expanding a patch or update in the main view will display more information about what is included a patch or update.                   Option to either stage or stage and install a patch or update from the VAMI. This capability was previously only available from the CLI.                      File-Based Backup ‚Äì was first introduced in vSphere 6.5 under the summary tab, now it has its own backup tab.                    Native scheduler included in the UI.                              Retention option available, select the number of backups to keep.                                Activities of completed and failed backup jobs logged with detailed information.                                File-Based Restore ‚Äì workflow now includes a backup achieve browser.                    The browser displays all your backups without having to know the entire backup path.                              External PSC restores are not supported when other replication partners are available.                                 External and Embedded Enhanced Linked Mode supported with the reconciliation of vSphere SSO domain credentials.                              ## Simplified ArchitectureIf you are like me, then you remember a time when vCenter Server architecture was simple. All vCenter Server services ran on a single instance. vSphere 5.1 changed this with Single Sign-On and distributed services. vSphere 6.0 simplified the architecture a bit eliminating distributed services. Giving us only two components, vCenter Server and the Platform Services Controller (PSC). One significant change for the VCSA 6.7 is around simplifying the architecture. Going back to running all vCenter Server services on a single instance. Introducing vCenter with Embedded PSC with Enhanced Linked Mode. Here are the benefits of this deployment model:      No load balancer required for high availability supports native vCenter Server High Availability.        Site boundary removal provides flexibility of placement        Supports vSphere scale maximums        Allows for 15 deployments in a vSphere Single Sign-On Domain        Reduces the number of nodes to manage and maintain  Migrate to the VCSANow that vSphere 6.7 is the last release to include vCenter Server for Windows, its now time to migrate to the VCSA. The built-in Migration Tool does all the heavy lifting. It brings over the vCenter Server identity, configuration, and inventory by default. Optional is historical and performance data. In vSphere 6.7 we can now select how to import the historical and performance data during a migration:- Import historical data in the background- Import all data now![](https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2018/04/VCSA-6.7-Migration-Data-Import.png?resize=1920%2C1080)Beside each of the data import options is an estimated time of how long each option will take when migrating. Estimated time will vary based on historical and performance data size in your environment. Selecting the data import in the background option gives the ability to pause and resume. Once the VCSA 6.7 is deployed and configured, log into the VAMI and a banner is displayed at the top to manage the data import along with the current percent.![](https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2018/04/VAMI-Pause-and-Resume.png?resize=1742%2C687)## Workload MobilityNow let‚Äôs talk about a different type of migration, the workload kind. vSphere 6.7 has enhancements removing the boundaries for workload mobility. vMotion 6.7 now supports workload mobility across vCenter Server versions going back to 6.0 U3. The only blocker was from 6.5 to 6.0 U3 which has removed in 6.5 U1.EVC is usually a cluster level setting, now in vSphere 6.7, it‚Äôs also a VM level setting with Per-VM EVC. Per-VM EVC takes us across clusters, datacenters, vCenters, and VMware Cloud on AWS. EVC, only allows CPUs from a single vendor, meaning you can not cross the streams between Intel and AMD. Per-VM EVC does require a VM to be on the latest VM compatibility version 14 included in vSphere 6.7.![](https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2018/04/Per-VM-EVC-6.7.png?resize=1672%2C797)## vSphere Client (HTML5)With vSphere 6.5 VMware introduced a supported version of the vSphere Client (HTML5). Included in the vCenter Server Appliance it only had partial functionality. The vSphere team has been working hard optimizing and improving workflows. This release takes us a step further with the following new workflows:- vSphere Update Manager- Content Library- vSAN- Storage Policies- Host Profiles- vDS Topology Diagram- Licensing- More‚Ä¶Some of the workflows mentioned above are not all feature complete. VMware will continue updating the vSphere Client outside of the normal vCenter Server release cycle through updates and patches.![](https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2018/04/vSphere-Client-6.7.png?resize=1280%2C720)## Platform Services Controller UISay goodbye to the PSC UI (/PSC) and hello to one less client. The PSC functionality is now part of the vSphere Client and all functionality is now located under the Administration menu. Certificate management has its own tab and all other PSC management is under the configuration tab.![](https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2018/04/PSC-UI.png?resize=1280%2C720)## ConclusionNow that you‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs new in the vCenter Server Appliance 6.7, go and give it a spin. I‚Äôll have more information shortly on enhancement mentioned above until then check out the following vSphere 6.7 resources: [release notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-67-release-notes.html), [documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLymLY4xJSThro4OL4w3PGSwsKi4zKT3Rs), and [configuration maximums](https://configmax.vmware.com/home) \\[ links coming soon\\]"

    "content": "Over the past year I have written several blog posts and conducted workshops on vSphere 6.5 upgrades. The intent was to help customers learn about the upgrade concepts and planning. Only by getting familiar with the concepts and planning accordingly will the execution be successful. Part of the upgrade journey is knowing what resources are available, where to find them, and how to use them . It gives me great pleasure to announce ‚ÄúThe Upgrading to VMware vSphere 6.5‚Ä≥ eBook. This is a new and free resource to help guide VMware customers with all stages of the vSphere 6.5 upgrade process. Let‚Äôs take a look on what‚Äôs included inside this new resource and help you impress your management and colleagues with your vSphere upgrade knowledge.The eBook first helps get VMware customers get acquainted with what‚Äôs new in vSphere 6.5. By getting familiar with the features and functionality in vSphere 6.5, a business case can presented to an organization‚Äôs stakeholders on the benefits of upgrading their current vSphere 5.5 or 6.0 environment. This is especially important for customer‚Äôs on vSphere 5.5, which is approaching end of support on September 19th, 2018. After learning about the what‚Äôs new of vSphere 6.5 it‚Äôs time to start looking at the upgrade process and creating an upgrade runbook. The eBook breaks this down into three phases:  Phase 1: Pre-upgrade ‚Äì the upfront work which should be done or considered prior to starting an upgrade  Phase 2: Upgrade ‚Äì mapping the steps of the upgrade process and execution  Phase 3: Post-Upgrade ‚Äì validating with business owners everything went according to planWithin each phase are details and considerations, but also links to resources to help. There are also two example upgrade scenarios:  vSphere 5.5 to vSphere 6.5  vSphere 6.0 to vSphere 6.5 Update 1Each scenario also includes a set of requirements and decisions used to determine the upgrade path. These examples may or may not relate to your current environment. The intent is to help familiarize customers with the upgrade process and concepts which they can apply to their specific situation. The eBook also contains a reference section loaded with important links to documents, knowledge base articles, tools, guides, etc. I hope you enjoy this new resource and may your upgrade planning and execution be successful."

    "content": "Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM) is a brand new feature available only for VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC), which was announced during VMworld US in August 2017. HLM provides the ability to extend an administrator‚Äôs management view from on-premises to VMC. This may sound oddly familiar if you are using Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM) in your on-premises environment. There are differences between ELM and HLM in their requirements, how they work, and what problem each is solving. William Lam has a post outlining the differences between the two features here. This post will go into detail on how to get HLM implemented.OverviewBefore jumping into the configuration of HLM it‚Äôs good having an understanding of the feature and its requirements. When a Cloud SDDC is deployed (a Cloud SDDC is an SDDC consisting of vCenter Server, ESXi, vSAN, and NSX deployed in the VMC on AWS service) and configured it is setup as its own stand-alone vSphere Single Sign-On domain. In order to manage both a VMC and your on-premises vSphere SSO domain together, these two separate SSO domains need to establish a trust. They also need to continue to retain their autonomy since HLM has the flexibility to be created and destroyed at will. For example, if we create HLM between a Cloud SDDC and an on-premises vSphere environment, we don‚Äôt want the two environments to become fundamentally dependent on each other. This gives us the ability to tear down HLM without breaking permissions and creating a huge mess.HLM is a flexible solution that allows us to jointly manage both the VMC and on-premises SSO domains. HLM provides a one-way trust from on-premises to VMC (i.e. VMC trusts the on-premises users) and gives us the option to link and unlink as needed. It also retains the separation between on-premises and VMC permissions to avoid a mess if we need to break the two environments apart. Once HLM is established, on-premises workloads can be migrated to VMC. The added bonus is that the migration works both ways and workloads can be migrated back from VMC to on-premises.Now let‚Äôs take a look at the features and requirements of HLM.FeaturesUpdate: November 28th release of VMC, HLM now supports external vCenter Server deployment on-premises.  The initial release supports embedded vCenter Server deployment model for both VMC and on-premises.  Not setup by default with an option to link and unlink as needed.  Configuration done in the VMC vSphere Client (HTML5).  Management of both environments is done by logging in the VMC vSphere Client using an on-prem account.  One way trust from on-prem to VMC.  Supports round-trip workload mobility via cold migration.Requirements  vSphere 6.5.0d (build 5318154) or higher is required for the on-premises embedded or external vCenter Server Appliance deployment.  VPN connectivity from the VMC management gateway to the on-premises environment.  Configuration of firewall rules from the VMC management console. By default, the firewall is set to deny all. Also, the necessary firewall ports need to be already opened in the on-premises vSphere environment.  A user account that has authority to add an identity source. Supported identity source types are Active Directory over LDAP(s) or Open LDAP.  Create or use an existing cloud administrator‚Äôs group from the on-premises identity source which will have access to login the VMC vCenter Server and manage both environments once HLM is configured.  vSphere SSO on-premises environment account information to link to the on-premises environment.          Platform Services Controller FQDN      SSO Domain Name      SSO User Name &amp; Password        On-premises DNS server entries ‚Äì these are used to resolve the on-premises identity source and Platform Services Controller.While you may be thinking there are currently some limitations to HLM, remember VMC is a managed service. This is what‚Äôs available in the initial release and additional enhancements will be added to the service over time.VMC Console  Before HLM can be configured, there are a few prerequisites which need to be in place prior to attempting configuration. A VPN connection must be established between the VMC management gateway and the on-premises environment.2. By default, the firewall in the VMC console is set to deny all. The assumption here is your on-premises vSphere environment already has the necessary firewall ports opened. Here are the required firewall ports for HLM to properly work:[table id=13 /]3. Enter the on-premises DNS server(s) in the VMC management gateway to resolve the on-premises identity source and Platform Services Controller which will be used when configuring HLM.Note: make sure you can resolve the VMC vCenter Server in your on-premises environment.HLM ConfigurationNow that all the prerequisites have been met, the actual HLM configuration consists of three steps.The HLM configuration takes place within the VMC vSphere Client (HTML5) which, by the way, is the only web client available. Login to the VMC vSphere Client using the cloudadmin@vmc.local credentials, which is the default equivalent to administrator@vsphere.local account in your on-premises vSphere environment.After logging in to the VMC vSphere Client, navigate to the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù option at the top of the screen and select ‚ÄúAdministration‚Äù.From the right-hand Administration pane go to the ‚ÄúHybrid Cloud‚Äù section and select ‚ÄúLinked Domains‚Äù.Step 1 ‚Äì Add Identity SourceClick on step one ‚ÄúAdd Identity Source‚Äù and fill out the necessary information about your on-premises identity source. In this example, Active Directory over LDAP is used.The Distinguished Name (DN) for both users and groups can be found in Active Directory by selecting the ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù or ‚ÄúGroups‚Äù OU ‚Äì&gt; right click and go to properties ‚Äì&gt; select the ‚ÄúAttributes Editor tab‚Äù ‚Äì&gt; find the distinguished name.Note: make sure the correct format is used for the distinguished name for both users and groups.There is also the option to add multiple identity source servers for redundancy if you choose. Only one server is required during configuration, but a secondary identity source server can be added after HLM has been configured. To view what Identity sources have been added or to add an additional identity server go to the Administration menu ‚Äì&gt; select the Configuration option ‚Äì&gt; go to the Identity Source tab. Options are also available to edit and remove and existing identity source as well.After the identity source has been added successfully a green check will appear on the completed step, allowing you to proceed to step 2.Step 2- Add Cloud Administrators GroupNow that an identity source has been added, the next step is adding the group that will have permission to manage the cloud SDDC. This group can be an existing one or a newly created group of members that are separate from your on-premises vSphere administrators group.Select the newly added identity source (previous step) from the dropdown menu.Type or search for the cloud administrators group. Members of this group will be able to login the VMC vSphere Client using their on-premises active directory accounts and manage both environments in a single view. Multiple groups can be added by repeating this process.The Cloud Administrator‚Äôs group has been successfully added and one more step to go!Step 3 ‚Äì Link to On-Prem DomainThe third and final step is adding information from your on-premises vSphere SSO domain (embedded deployment).Enter the necessary information which includes PSC FQDN, SSO Domain Name, SSO User, and Password. The HTTPS port is filled in by default using 443.Note: If you deployed your on-premises VCSA using FQDN or IP Address which is registered with its lookup service, use the same information when filling out this wizard for the VMC PSC name.Once the on-premises and VMC SSO domains establish a trust, HLM is now configured and you will need to login with your on-premises credentials. Once you click OK, you will automatically be logged out of the VMC vSphere Client.There is a user account and a couple of solution users accounts created by default on the on-premises vCenter Server when HLM is configured. These accounts today can only be viewed in the flash version of the vSphere Web Client and they should not be manipulated in any way as they will affect the communication between your on-premises vCenter Server and your VMC vCenter Server.synceservice ‚Äì Local User for HybridVC Servicehvc &amp; vsphere-webclient ‚Äì these solution users match the same accounts in VMC. In the screens below the top screenshot shows the VMC vSphere Client and the bottom screen shows the on-premises vSphere Web Client.HLM ManagementOnce HLM is configured log back in the VMC vSphere Client using your on-premises credentials. Using your on-premises credentials is the only way to manage both on-premises and Cloud SDDC using HLM.Note: User Principal Name should be used UserName@Domain.comAfter logging in with your on-premises account your greeted with screen showing vSphere domains have been linked. Also on this screen is the option to also unlink at any time.From the hosts and clusters view you can see and manage both your vSphere on-premises and cloud SDDC environments in a single view while retaining separate permissions.Once all the initial network and firewall requirements have been met, HLM is really only three easy steps. Today HLM can only be established by logging in the VMC vCenter Server with your on-premises credentials, but as I mentioned earlier VMC is a managed service and new functionality will be added at a rapid pace. We can now move workloads via cold migration between our on-premises and cloud SDDC by simply right clicking on a single VM or multiple and selecting migrate. The same wizard that you use today on-premises is present which is another benefit of VMC on AWS. Now your current on-premises vSphere skills translate to the cloud and you can just focus on the important piece ‚Äì workload management ‚Äì while VMware takes care of the rest.You may also take a look at the following video which covers the HLM process as well.&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m28MR_U1LmQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" width=\"640\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;"

    "content": "Recently, some macOS Sierra users have had an issue with the VCSA 6.5 installer. At the ‚ÄúSet up appliance VM‚Äù (step 5), the VCSA deployment and storage sizes are not available. The following error is received ‚ÄúA problem occurred while reading the OVF file.. Error: ovftool is not available‚Äù. Let me start by saying this is not an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra is currently not supported with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update. The supported system requirements for the VCSA installer are here. With that said, I want to shed more light on why this is happening and what options are available with Sierra.Apple prefers that applications are signed and distributed from the App store. Recommendations for delivery outside the App store are signed disk images or installer packages. These images are signed with a unique Developer ID. Apple has made a change starting with Sierra on how applications are launched. An application from an ISO will be isolated by Gatekeeper to an unspecified read-only location. If you look at the VCSA installer log, there is a randomly given path. The change is to help prevent malware. Currently, Apple is not providing a way to sign ISO images. By the way, Apple has removed the option to allow apps downloaded from anywhere in Sierra as seen in the screenshot below. There is a command to enable it, but it still doesn‚Äôt work as mentioned above regarding the ISO. There are a few workaround options to use the VCSA 6.5 installer on Sierra.Option 1:Extract or copy the contents of the VCSA ISO to a directory on the local Mac filesystem. This option, in my opinion, is the quickest and easiest. It can be helpful having a local copy for scripting. You will need to run the following command to remove the attributes. Removing the attributes clears the restrictions and lets Sierra know the VCSA installer is trusted. Another reason I prefer this method is its persistency only needs to be done once.sudo xattr -rc Installer.app/  Note: copying the VCSA ISO contents to a directory and running it without the above command is hit and miss. You may end up with the following error. If so, run the command to remove the attributes.Option 2:Look at the installer log, which is available to download from the installer. The log points to the path where the ovftool is missing. Copy the entire VCSA directory from the ISO to the private directory. Keep in mind this solution is non-persistent and will have to be done every time the ISO is mounted. The location is random which will require looking at the installer logs every time.2016-11-21T06:44:11.114Z ‚Äì debug: Deployment size page description: Select the deployment size for this vCenter Server with an Embedded Platform Services Controller.2016-11-21T06:44:11.115Z ‚Äì debug: scope.backupProfileDataArr: undefined2016-11-21T06:44:11.116Z ‚Äì error: could not find ovftoolCmd: /private/var/folders/j7/f6_0rwmd2w571_3jn6y_hz1w00_tnx/T/AppTranslocation/vcsa/ovftool/mac/ovftool2016-11-21T06:44:11.116Z ‚Äì info: ovftoolCmd: null2016-11-21T06:44:11.117Z ‚Äì error: OVF probe error: Error: ovftool is not availableThere you have it, two possible ways to use the VCSA 6.5 installer on Sierra.

    "content": "The vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 has significant new features and improvements mentioned here. One area of notice is the installer, which in this release not only has a new look and feel but other improvements. These improvements are not only visible from the ISO, but also during the deployment. The end result is a better experience throughout the VCSA deployment process. Let‚Äôs jump in and take a closer look.Pre-InstallThe VCSA installer is now browser agnostic, which makes it more portable. Along those lines, the Client Integration Plugin (CIP) is no longer needed. CIP provided browser functions such as importing an OVF/ OVA which are now native. Other CIP provided functions that are now native include:  Exporting VM or vApp as an OVF / OVA  Deploying OVF / OVA from a local file system or URL  Exporting and importing from Content Library to the local file system  Downloading and uploading files to and from a datastore  Connecting remote devices to a VM (CD-ROM, USB, etc.)You may have noticed a couple of items missing from this list. Windows Authentication (SSPI) and Smart Card Authentication will still require a plugin. The Enhanced Authentication Plugin (EAP) will be available to enable these two functions.A couple of things to mention about EAP:  EAP will require a Windows operating system to download and install.  A CipMsgProxyService is running after the EAP is installed.Finally, the installer now supports use on macOS, Linux, and Windows. As always check the documentation to see supported OS versions. The installer will have the following minimum hardware configuration requirements for best performance:[table id=9 /]DeploymentUp to this point the discussion has been about the exterior installer improvements. Now let‚Äôs shift gears and discuss the hotness inside. There is now the flexibility to move backward in the navigation pane on the left side. Moving forward still requires clicking next in the designated section as usual. Don‚Äôt worry any information entered will still be available when you move between screens.Previously the VCSA installer only had one stage. This meant any issues that occurred during the deployment would require a complete re-deploy. Of course, this was a pain when starting a deployment and walking away only to come back and find it had failed. Those days are now in the past, the VCSA 6.5 installer is now a two stage deployment process. Stage 1 deploys the OVA, configures basic networking, and starts the VAMI service. Stage 2 is the setup / configuration of the VCSA. After Stage 1 is complete you are presented with two options, to either close the installer or continue on to Stage 2. This ability to close the installer between stages provides a few possibilities. The first is the opportunity to take a snapshot between stages, in case any mistakes occur during Stage 2. Just for the record, taking snapshots between stages while handy is not supported. Second, if you have pressing business to take care of, you can always come back and finish the VCSA configuration later through the VAMI. The VAMI provides the option to continue the setup of the VCSA, starting at Stage2.One benefit to having a two stage deployment is better validation checks. The installer does validation checks at each stage, and in the case of any errors, there is now better error messaging. If there are errors, the installer logs are presented for troubleshooting. Depending on the issue presented there is the possibility of correcting it and proceeding with the installation.Along with the previous deployment sizes of Tiny-Large, this release introduces X-Large. The new X-Large size allows up to 2K hosts and 35K powered on VMs. The new size requires 24 vCPUs, 48GB of RAM, and 980GB of storage. Also, a new addition to the deployment size is the ability to increase the VCSA storage size. Two storage increase options are available to us Large and X-Large. Select one of these options if you want to increase the initial VCSA deployment size for SEAT data. SEAT stands for Stats, Events, Alarms, and Tasks. Changing the VCSA deployment size and storage is possible after deployment as well. A few things to note that have changed from the VCSA 6.0 sizes from the previously mentioned include:  External Platform Services Controller size is now 2 vCPU &amp; 4GB of RAM.  Embedded deployments (VCSA and PSC on the same VM) are now 2 vCPU and 10GB of RAM[table id=8 /]The VCSA installer has improved significantly from the previous 6.0 release. Shout out to the vCenter team for listening to its customers and providing a better user experience."

    "content": "During VMworld Barcelona 2016, VMware announced vSphere 6.5. With lots of new features and updates, this is one of the biggest vSphere releases we have had in a while. Leading the charge is none other than the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). VMware‚Äôs direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it‚Äôs quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I‚Äôll go into more details in future blog posts. Time to take a look at what‚Äôs new and why migrate2vcsa you should üôÇVCSA 6.5 ISOStarting with the VCSA 6.5 ISO, improvements are easily visible when comparing to 6.O:  The Migration Tool is now built into the VCSA installer.  One of the biggest asks from customers is now part of this release. VMware Update Manager (VUM) no longer requires a Windows Server and runs natively on the VCSA. Included on the ISO is Update Manager Download Service (UMDS). UMDS is available for those that have restrictions on internet connectivity to VUM.  The VCSA ova is available and can be used as one alternative for deployments.  My favorite part, the JSON templates have been updated and include improvements. This release includes around 30 templates covering install, upgrade, and migrate  The VCSA installer now sports a new modern look, independent of a browser. There is also support for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Deploying VCSA from my macOS, yes, please!VCSA Only FeaturesMigrationAs mentioned earlier the Migration Tool in the VCSA 6.5 is now built-in. This version of the Migration Tool improvements include:  Migration of Windows vCenter Server 5.5 or 6.0 to VCSA 6.5  Improved Performance in the migration process  More options for historical and performance data selection  VMware Update Manager migration part of the VCSAvCenter High AvailabilityThis solution consists of an Active, Passive, and Witness nodes. The Passive and Witness nodes are clones from the original (Active) vCenter Server. There are two supported workflows: Basic &amp; Advanced.  The Basic workflow will clone the nodes, and create rules for placement. DRS and Storage DRS are not requirements but provide automated placement when available. The Basic workflow is flexible, allowing the choice of node placement within a cluster or across clusters within a vCenter Server.  Placing nodes in different clusters, datacenters, or vCenter Servers requires the Advanced workflow. This is a manual process, including cloning of the nodes and placement.Remember, this is a High Availability solution, not a Disaster Recovery solution. Make sure to repeat that as you‚Äôre deploying VCHA.Backup / RestoreA native file-based solution allows the backup of an embedded or external deployment. Also supports the backup of individual appliances: VCSA or PSC.  Start the Backup workflow from the VMware vSphere Appliance Management Interface or API.  This release supports the following protocols: HTTP(s), FTP(s), and SCP.  Streamed are a set of files that make up the VCSA configuration to the supported protocols.  Hot backup of the VCSA, no quiescence required.  Launch the Restore workflow from the VCSA ISO and point to the protocol used to backup.  Deployed is a new VCSA, keeping its personality (FQDN, IP, UUID, etc.) and configuration including inventory.Management InterfaceThe VMware vSphere Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) has a new sexy facelift in 6.5.Not only that but new features that prove the much-needed visibility to the VCSA. This interface now shows CPU, Memory, and Network statistics. Also visibility to the VCSA Database statistics, disk space, and health providing improved monitoring. Syslog Configuration is now part of the VAMI as well.More ImprovementsThe ISO is the not the only place you‚Äôll see improvements. The vCenter Server appliance and application also got some of the new hotness, take a look.  Photon OS ‚Äì the VCSA is the first VMware appliance to run on Photon OS.          This provides a significant reduction in boot time and vCenter application startup times.      It also means that VMware owns the stack, which is beneficial for patching and support.        2 Stage deployment provides better validation checks.          Stage 1 deploys OVF      Stage 2 for configuration        VMON -Enhanced watchdog functionality          Checks health of each service      vCenter Server: Windows and Appliance      First level of defense ‚Äì application restart        Client Integration Plugin (CIP) ‚Äì is no longer required, replaced by native browser functions.  Enhanced Authentication Plugin ‚Äì only If you plan on using Windows Authentication (SSPI) or Smart Card Authentication.ClientsBefore I talk about the Web Client, let me state the C# (thick) client is gone and not available. The 6.0 version of the C# client will not work with a vSphere 6.5 environment. That was for you Adam, hope you‚Äôre happy.  The new HTML5 ‚ÄúvSphere Client‚Äù based on the Fling is now available on the VCSA.  vSphere Client is fully supported in VCSA 6.5.  Limited functionality of the vSphere Client is available in this release.  Future updates of the vSphere Client will be available separately from vCenter Server.  vSphere Web Client ‚Äì Adobe Flex (https://FQDN or IP Address of VCSA/vsphere‚Äìclient)  vSphere Client -HTML5 (https://FDQN or IP Address of VCSA/UI)  Host Client ‚Äì HTML5 (https://FQDN or IP Address of ESXi host/UI -&gt; available since vSphere 6.0 Update 2  vSphere Appliance Management ‚Äì HTML5 (https://FQDN or IP Address of VCSA:5480)  PSC Management UI ‚Äì HTML5 -&gt; available since vSphere 6.0 Update 1          External deployments (https://FQDN or IP Address of PSC/PSC)      Embedded deployments (https://FQDN or IP Address of VCSA/PSC)      Web Client has received love this release with performance improvements and live refresh. The days of hitting the refresh button are over, it now happens in real time! The Related Object tab is gone, replaced with a flat menu comparable to the C# client. Also, renamed is the Manage tab to Configure, more intuitive of the available tasks.CLI / Automation  Simplified Bash Shell now just type ‚Äúshell‚Äù  REST APIs / API Explorer.  Datacenter CLI (DCLI) ‚Äì a native client for the REST APIs.          Accessible via vCLI, VCSA Shell, Windows CMD prompt.      DCLI also has you covered with auto-tab completion, no need to remember commands.      Note: example below using SSH from my Mac to VCSA 6.5.The VCSA has seen a lot of improvements since its initial release in vSphere 5.0. Now with the vSphere 6.5 release, the VCSA will show why it‚Äôs the first choice deployment. In this release the VCSA has an abundant amount of exclusive features and improvements. Not only that, now there are Migration Tools that will do all the heavy lifting to get you there. Future blog posts will cover these feature and improvements more in depth, so stay tuned. In the mean time start planning those VCSA deployments and migrations üôÇ"

    "content": "I recently wrote about the release of the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling and how to configure it. Since then there has already been an update to the Fling. I‚Äôve gone through update process in my lab using the rpm, but I also decided to deploy a new OVA (version 1.1) and found a few hidden features.During the configuration of the appliance I found a directory called ‚Äúvspherefeatures‚Äù. The directory contains a configuration file with three disabled entries. Of course the first thing that came to mind is what‚Äôs the harm in just enabling one to see what happens. What happened was me enabling all three after seeing the first one worked.The Three hidden features are Datastore File Browser, Add Host Wizard, and Network Selector. I‚Äôm assuming that these are features that will be available in future releases of the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling. For now looks like we can get a sneak peak üôÇEnabling Hidden FeaturesNote: This was tested using a new vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling version 1.1 OVA.  SSH into vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling Appliance.  Go to /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/vsphereFeatures   Edit the configuration file ‚ÄúvsphereFeatures.cfg‚Äù I‚Äôm using VI to make changes.   There are three disabled options          Datastore File Browser      Add Host Wizard      Network Selector        Change the setting from disabled to enabled and save the configuration file.   Restart the web server service /etc/init.d/vsphere-client restart.   Once the web service has been restarted, login the HTML5 Web Client https://&lt;FQDN or IP of HTML5 Appliance&gt; :9443/uiFeaturesThe Datastore File Browser feature can be found by going to Storage and selecting a Datastore ‚Äì&gt; Manage ‚Äì&gt; Files. Here you can download files, create files, search within a datastore, and delete files or folders.Add Host Wizard can be found by performing a right click at the Datacenter level or using Datacenter Actions. We now have the ability to add a new ESXi host.Network Selector can be found when editing a VM ‚Äì&gt; Network Adapter ‚Äì&gt; Network drop down ‚Äì&gt; Show more networks. This feature provides the ability to change a virtual machine‚Äôs network when editing.There you have it three hidden features that are not currently available today in the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling. I would keep an eye out on this configuration file as new updates are released there may be more hidden features. Now if you‚Äôll excuse me I have some feedback to provide üôÇ"

    "content": "VMware¬†announced¬†the first step towards making a HTML5 Web Client a¬†reality, the¬†vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling. This first release¬†of the Fling will focus primarily on VM management, with more updates coming.¬† Here is a list of the features and operations available in this first release:  VM power operations  VM Edit Settings (simple CPU, Memory, Disk changes)  VM Console  VM and Host Summary pages  VM Migration (only to a Host)  Clone to Template/ VM  Create VM on a Host (limited)  Additional monitoring views: Performance charts, Tasks, Event  Global Views: Recent tasks, Alarms (view only)  Integrated Feedback ToolThe vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling is a standalone appliance that can be deployed in your existing or new vSphere 6.0 and later environments in a transparent manner. The Fling does not make any changes to your existing vCenter or Platform Services Controller components. Nor does it affect any operations, such as the use of the current vSphere Web Client, as it is meant to run side by side. The Fling should be deployed with the following specifications and prerequisites in mind:  2vCPU, 4GB of RAM, and 14GB of storage  Runs only on vSphere 6.0 or later  Recommended Browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and IE11. Other browsers may work, but have not been tested yet  Usable with either the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) or Windows  Enable SSH on your vCenter Server Appliance, temporarily needed only during the install process  Enable vCenter Server Appliance Bash Shell, temporarily needed to SCP configuration files from the Fling to the vCenter Server Appliance          shell.set ‚Äìenable True      shell      chsh ‚Äìs /bin/bash root      [IMAGE HERE]vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling DeploymentPrior to deploying the vSphere HTML5 web client Fling appliance verify all specifications are in place and prerequisites have been met. The Fling OVF can be deployed using either the vSphere 6.0 Web Client or¬†Embedded Host Client. Go through the deploy OVF Template wizard, power on the the fling appliance and wait for the boot process to complete. When the Fling appliance is at the console screen, SSH using the login username¬†root¬†and password¬†demova.Note:¬†when deploying with the vSphere client (aka C# or Thick client) an IP pool is required. This is taken care of for you when using the vSphere Web Client.Let‚Äôs go through the process of configuring the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling with both the vCenter Server Appliance and vCenter for WindowsConfiguration with the vCenter Server ApplianceStep 1¬†Run the following command to register the Fling appliance with vCenter Server Appliance:/etc/init.d/vsphere-client configure ‚Äìstart yes ‚Äìuser root ‚Äìvc¬† --ntp ÔøºStep 2Continue the registration process by answering ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to continue connecting and entering your vCenter Server Appliance password.ÔøºDuring the registration process the following configuration files are created and copied from the vCenter Server Appliance to the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling:¬†webclient.properties,¬†ds.properties, and¬†store.jks.¬† Making sure the vCenter Server Appliance bash shell is enabled allows for SCP to copy these configuration files over to the Fling Appliance. Finally, the registration script is starting the web server, also installing any packages and plugins needed.ÔøºConfiguration with vCenter for WindowsAs stated earlier the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling also works with vCenter 6.0 for Windows. The process is similar to the vCenter Server Appliance. In this release of the Fling there is more manual configuration that is done on the Windows side, but this will be more automated in a future release of the Fling.¬† This configuration was done running vCenter 6.0 on Windows Server 2012 R2, but other versions of windows may also work.¬†Step 1Visit the¬†vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling site¬†download the Fling OVA and the¬†server-configure.bat. Deploy the Fling appliance and power on.ÔøºStep 2On your vCenter Windows server Run the server-configure.bat as administrator or with an account that has local administrator rights. The same configuration files created on the vCenter Server Appliance (webclient.properties, ds.properties, store.jks) are also created on Windows.Note:¬†The script assumes vCenter was installed using the default path. Modify the install path in the script to your vCenter path.ÔøºNote:¬†If you run the server-configuration.bat without administrator rights you will receive errors and the correct files are not created.ÔøºStep 3SSH into the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling appliance and create the necessary directories for the configuration files:  mkdir /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/  mkdir /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/config/  mkdir /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/vsphere-client/ÔøºOnce the directories are created, copy and place the configuration files in the corresponding directory.Note: In this example WinSCP was used to copy the configuration files to their directories on the Fling Appliance.  /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/store.jks  /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/config/ds.properties  /etc/vmware/vsphere-client/vsphere-client/webclient.propertiesÔøºStep 4To add NTP server(s) run the following command on the Fling appliance/etc/init.d/vsphere-client configure ntp_servers &lt;IP address of NTP server(s)&gt;Note:¬†It‚Äôs important to keep time in sync between vCenter and the Fling appliance.ÔøºStep 5Start the vSphere HTML5 Web Client web server¬†/etc/init.d/vsphere-client startÔøº    Accessing the HTML5 Client    Once the vSphere HTML5 Client Web server is started go to:https://:9443/uiÔøºThe login screen should look familiar! You‚Äôre now officially logged in the new vSphere HTML5 Web Client. There are a few things I would like to point out:    Logon load time improved, takes 5-6 seconds.  Faster overall speed and response time.  Search is now in the top center of the page.  Smiley face in the upper right hand corner is the feedback tool.  Tabs have been simplified.  Clicking on the word ‚ÄúvSphere Client‚Äù in the upper left takes you home.ÔøºOne important feature is the smiley face in the upper right hand corner. While it looks really innocent, it does actually serve a purpose. It‚Äôs your gateway to engineering, or we‚Äôll call it the feedback tool. This is your chance to provide valuable input and help shape your future client.Ôøº    Troubleshooting    Here are a few things to validate incase you run into any issues on the way:    Use the following command to check the status of the vSphere Client Web Server service/etc/init.d/vsphere-client statusÔøº  Other commands include stop, start, and restart  Verify SSH is enabled on the vCenter Server Appliance  Validate time is in sync between the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling Appliance and vCenter Server  Make sure the vCenter Server Appliance Bash Shell is enabledÔøº  If using custom certificates, use the FQDN of the vCenter server during the initial registrationHTML5 technology is not new to VMware. The Platform Services Controller UI (6.0 U1) and the Embedded Host Client (6.0 U2), both fully support HTML5. Take the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling for a test drive and provide feedback ‚Äì this is your HTML5 client, help shape its future üôÇ"

The vSphere Web Client would be the future management tool replacing the vSphere client aka ‚ÄúLegacy, Thick or C# Client‚Äù. This would be become more evident over time with each release of vSphere. New features could only be managed through the vSphere Web Client. While the concept of a browser based client is a step in the right direction, the dependency of flash was not. Keep in mind the decision to use flash was made when it was the standard for web applications, times and standards have changed. With that change it has taken some time to work on replatforming the vSphere Web Client. This always leads to the question, when will we see a HTML5 version of the Web Client? I‚Äôm happy to announce the wait is over!The first step towards making a HTML5 Web Client a reality is the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling. This release of the Fling will focus primary on VM management, with more updates coming. Here is a list of the features and operations available in this first release:  VM power operations  VM Edit Settings (simple CPU, Memory, Disk changes)  VM Console  VM and Host Summary pages  VM Migration (only to a Host)  Clone to Template/ VM  Create VM on a Host (limited)  Additional monitoring views: Performance charts, Tasks, Event  Global Views: Recent tasks, Alarms (view only)  Integrated Feedback ToolHTMl5 ClientThe vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling is a standalone appliance that can be deployed in your existing or new vSphere 6.0 environments.

If you would like to be kept up to date with the latest vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling news fill out the the following form and stay tuned for more to come.Take the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling for a test drive and most importantly provide feedback. It took six months or so for the Embedded Host Client (EHC) Fling to be a feature rich product now included in vSphere 6.0 U2.

    "content": "A New Year not only represents a new calendar year, for many it also symbolizes a time of change. Reassessing what‚Äôs going on in their lives and what change, if any do they want to introduce. It‚Äôs usually the most common time for new job opportunities or changes to occur. Recently several members in the community have made some significant moves. Anything from different companies, geographic locations, roles, and others just taking a sabbatical. While these types of job changes aren‚Äôt easy, they‚Äôre needed to get us to the next step of our journey.With that said I‚Äôm making a change of my own. I‚Äôm excited to be joining VMware today as a Senior Technical Marketing Engineer (TME) ‚Äì Implementation Lead. This role reports into the Cloud Platform Business Unit (CPBU), which is part of the R&amp;D organization. I‚Äôll be working alongside a great team that includes awesome folks like Mike Foley and Adam Eckerle.What exactly will I be doing? This role is a little different from your typical TME role at VMware. It‚Äôs more of a hybrid role. I‚Äôll be working with customers on VMware product implementations and providing customer feedback. Like a consultant, but not having to worry about the billable hours. Along with the typical TME duties of providing collateral, blogging, speaking, etc. My initial focus will be vCenter Server, specifically the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). I‚Äôll be helping with new deployments as well as migrations from Windows. The VCSA is the future and I‚Äôm excited to be one of its advocates.I want to thank all those who provided me advice and support for my career growth, you know who you are. I‚Äôm really excited about the opportunity and the people that I‚Äôll get to work with. Feels like I‚Äôve gone from playing at the Lego store with access to certain bricks to the factory üôÇ"

    "content": "This blog post allows me to bring two of my favorite things together. I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it‚Äôs evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is Ravello. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.We all know the awesomeness that happens when you combine the two slices. This is the same effect when bringing together the VCSA and Ravello. This wasn‚Äôt an easy task, consisting of several attempts and asking lots of questions, but it‚Äôs now doable!The ProblemWith the VCSA 6.0 VMware changed the deployment format from OVA/OVF to ISO. This introduces some problems when trying to directly import on Ravello. Some of the problems are:  ISOs are a supported format on Ravello, but there‚Äôs no way to access the VCSA files natively.  Currently there‚Äôs no support for uploading an OVA. VCSA OVA format (vmware-vcsa) located on ISO.  Deploying a VCSA to a ESXi host, Workstation, Fusion, or vSphere environment and export to OVF. This results in the following error:The problem is the number of disks. The VCSA requires 11 disks, while Ravello currently supports a maximum of 7 disks per HBA on their end.Fear not, there‚Äôs a way to get the VCSA on Ravello!ConsiderationsThere are a few things you should consider before starting this process.  Naming ‚Äì When deploying your VCSA once you provide it a FQDN or IP address it can‚Äôt be changed, at least in a supported manner. The PNID is tied to the FQDN or IP address and is referenced in many places (KB2130599 &amp; KB2124422). The only option is to redeploy.  DNS, DNS, DNS ‚Äì Make sure forward and reverse DNS is configured.  NTP ‚Äì Configuring time is important for troubleshooting, configuration management, and security.Note: I deployed my VCSA based on my home lab domain, using a FQDN. I knew that I would be building the same domain in Ravello. If you aren‚Äôt sure or not planning on doing the same, your best bet is to deploy using an IP address.VCSA Prep Work  Deploy the VCSA to an ESXi host, vCenter Server (6.0 U1), Workstation, Fusion, or vSphere environment. My example is based on deploying to my vSphere lab.  Once your VCSA has been deployed, power it off.  Add a second SCSI controller to the VCSA.   Move Hard disks 8-11 to the new SCSI controller (SCSI controller 1) .[table id=6 /]  Edit the VCSA settings in the vSphere web client.          Click Manage other disks, and expand the hard disk you‚Äôre making the change to.      Change the Virtual Device Node to SCSI controller 1 and the next available SCSI Bus / Device number starting with 1:0.         Here‚Äôs a logical view of the VCSA hard disks under their respected SCSI controller from the vSphere C# client.  Note: Ravello will automatically add a second HBA on their end to support the newly added SCSI controller.    Power on the VCSA, make sure that it‚Äôs still functional and you have access to the web client. Once that‚Äôs been verified power off the VCSA.  Export the VCSA as a OVF.   Select the export directory and verify format is OVF. Click OK.       Convert stream-optimized VMDK disks to non-stream-optimized disks before uploading them to Ravello. Per the following Ravello KB article. Download and install QEMU for windows or Linux and run the following command: qemu-img convert -p -f vmdk -O vmdk ‚Äúoriginal vmdk file‚Äù ‚Äúnew vmdk file‚Äù    Note: This must be done for all 11 VCSA disks.     Now there should be 22 VMDK disks, 11 original &amp; 11 new. I recommend backing up the 11 original in case you need them at a later date. I created a backup directory and moved them there. Now rename the new VMDK disks to the original names.Note: Another option is to create the new VMDK disks in a separate directory, this will save time with having to rename. You will have to copy the .mf and .ovf files over.      The manifest file (.mf) stores the SHA1 hases for each disk and needs to be updated. Microsoft has a free tool called File Checksum Integrity Verifier (FCIV).fciv.exe -sha1 ‚Äúpath of the vmdk‚Äù        Open the manifest file (.mf) with your favorite editor and replace each VMDK hash with the newly generated one.Finally, done with the prep work and ready to start getting this bad boy on Ravello.Importing VCSA on Ravello  Login the Ravello VM Import Tool and select Upload a VM from OVF file or Ravello Export file. Click Next.   Navigate to the VCSA directory and select the OVF. Click Upload.   Away we go! The upload process has started, sit back and relaxed you‚Äôve earned it. Plus there‚Äôs nothing more to do until the upload is finished. Ravello VCSA Configuration  Login your Ravello account and create a new application. I created one called VCSA üôÇ  Prior to adding the VCSA to the newly created application we need to verify its configuration. Go to Library ‚Äì&gt; VM and select the VCSA that was just uploaded. One the right hand side click Edit &amp; Verify VM.   Select the System tab, here you can increase the number of CPUs or RAM. By default a tiny deployment starts with 2 CPUs and 8GB of RAM.  Go to the Disk tab and verify that the VCSA hard disks are in order. If not place them in the correct number order using the arrows.  Select the Network tab and add a static IP address, Network Mask, Gateway, and DNS.  Go to the Services tab, add the following services [table id=7 /]  After verifying all setting, save changes and click Publish.   Start the VCSA and launch the console when available.  You will be greeted with the following warning message, for now press any key to continue. The VCSA will continue the start up process.   Login the VCSA console (Alt-F1).  Type ‚Äúshell.set ‚Äìenabled True‚Äú, hit enter and type ‚Äúshell‚Äù  Edit the boot.compliance script vi /etc/init.d/boot.compliance  Changes will be made to lines 47 and 48.  Line 47 should read MSG = ‚Äò/usr/bin/isCompliant -q‚Äô  Line 48 should read CODE=0  Save changes and exit.  Restart the VCSA to verify you no longer receive the boot warning.  Now that the VCSA configurations are all done, time to save your hard work to the VM library for future use.Web Client Access  To access the web client, from a web browser type ‚Äúhttps://public IP address of the VCSA/vsphere-client‚Äù.  Accept the self signed certificates.  If you‚Äôre having issues accessing the web client, then there‚Äôs an issue with your DNS. Easy test is to edit the host file on your local machine adding the public IP address of the VCSA. Refresh your browser and see if you have access to the web client.  Note: Don‚Äôt forget that VCSA public IP address will change, so if it‚Äôs added to the host file on your machine you will need to change it.There you have it, the VCSA can now be deployed directly on Ravello providing even more flexibility. Have fun building your lab in the cloud, I know I will."

    "content": "VMworld 2015 has come and gone, at least the US version. There were several sessions giving love to vCenter. This included the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). Here are a few of the sessions that are worth a look.INF5975 ‚Äì vCenter Server Appliance as First Choice VC INF4528- vCenter Server Appliance VCSA Best Practices &amp; Tips Tricks INF4944- Managing vSphere 6.0 Deployments and Upgrades, Part 1INF4945 ‚Äì vCenter Server 6 High AvailabilityGUI DeploymentFor a new deployment, you now have the option of two deployment targets. ESXi has been the only option until now, introducing vCenter Server as a deploy target.If you select vCenter Server as a target, two new options are added to the deployment menu on the left. The first is ‚ÄúSelect Datacenter‚Äù and second, ‚ÄúSelect Resource‚Äù. The rest of the deployment process is the same as before.Scripted DeploymentAside from the GUI deployment, there is also a scripted deployment. This was also introduced in 6.0, but now with more additions. The VCSA-Cli-Installer directory\\Templates directory contains the JSON scripts.For new deployments utilize the scripts from the install directory. This directory now has 8 JSON scripts that spans both ESXi and vCenter.Introduced in U1, an upgrade script method has been added. The upgrade directory has JSON scripts that allow upgrades from 5.1 U3 and 5.5. More on how to upgrade later.More details about scripted VCSA deployments can be found here .UpgradeNote: Supported upgrade paths to VCSA 6.0 U1 include from 5.1 U3 &amp; 5.5.While on the topic of upgrades, going from VCSA 6.o to 6.0 U1 is quite simple. First, you‚Äôll need a patch ISO, which can be found on here. You ‚Äòll notice there are two patch ISOs, FP and TP.FP is a full product patch for VC &amp; PSC appliances only.TP is third party patch spanning multiple products, such as VCSA, vCenter Windows, VUM, PSC appliance and windows.Note: Make sure you read the corresponding patch KB prior to upgrading.Attach the patch ISO to the VCSA cd-rom and run the following command ‚Äúsoftware-packages ‚Äìinstall ‚Äìiso ‚ÄìacceptEulas‚Äú.After the upgrade is complete a reboot is required for the VCSA.VCSA 5.1 U3 or 5.5 upgrades can be done from the 6.0 U1 ISO. Select Upgrade from the vcsa-setup and go through the wizard. You will need a temporary IP address, as the process deploys a new VCSA and ports over all the info. Once completed the old version of the VCSA will be shutdown.As mentioned above scripted upgrades are also supported.Virtual Appliance Management Interface (VAMI)VCSA 6.0 was minus an old friend, the VAMI. VCSA 6.0 U1 the VAMI has returned! (applause). Not only is it back, but a with a new look in HTML5. To access the VAMI go to https://FQDN or IP of VCSA:5480.The new interface is definitely noticeable. Also the menus are now located on the left hand side of the UI instead of along of the top as in previous releases.Two things that I would like to point out. First, the update menu has the ability to check for updates. This can be done atomically or by using a repository. Future updates will have the ability to be applied from here.Secondly, the option to change your root password and expiration settings are under the administration menu. Make sure your vCenter SMTP is configured to received the expiration warnings. In case you were wondering the max number of days allowed is 99,999 (security!).Web ClientFrom the web client perceptive, two new icons have been added by default. The Hybrid Cloud Manager, which extends connectivity to vCloud Air. The other is the Customer Experience Improvement. There are no annoying messages asking to join and is disabled by default.There is now an option to change to a remote syslog server. Go to System Configuration and select Services. Look for VMware Syslog Service and click the Manage tab.VUM IntegrationWe finally have VMware Update Manager (VUM) integration in the web client, well sort of. A windows installation is still required for VUM. The upside is now all the VUM functions are now available in the web client, so we‚Äôre getting closer. Once VUM is pointed to vCenter, logout of the web client and back in, ta-da!Note: This integration is also available with Windows version of vCenterBackup / RestoresSupport for VCSA backups via VMware vSphere Storage APIs ‚Äì Data Protection (formley VADP) has been extended. In addition to VCSA with embedded PSC support, now external PSC has been added. This can be done leveraging VMware‚Äôs VDP or any third party solution with VMware vSphere Storage APIs ‚Äì Data Protection, like Veeam. In this example I‚Äôm using VDP 6.1 and have taken backups of my external PSC and VCSA.If corruption or a crash occurs to the VCSA and a restore is required are you prepared? Your solution although runs on VMware and is integrated with the VCSA should have a way to bring it back. In this example using VDP 6.1 Emergency Restore feature. Verify you have a solution or plan in place to bring the VCSA to life during such catastrophes.Platform Services Controller (PSC)There are a couple new items for the Platform Services Controller with this release. PSC has a new UI just like the VAMI, in HTML5. To access go to https:// FQDN or IP of VCSA/PSC. This new UI is useful for troubleshooting and Certificate management. The appliance settings menu has a link to redirect to the VAMI, integration at its finest.The command CMSSO-UTIL, now provides more flexibility. Allows you to repoint a VCSA with embedded PSC to external. This is great IMO so you no longer have to redeploy a new setup if you need to switch to an external PSC. Just make sure your PSC are in SSO domain.As you can see, VCSA 6.0 update 1 is packed with a lot of goodness. VMware is definitely listening when it comes to vCenter, especially on the VCSA. This was more evident in this year‚Äôs sessions, with more detailed tech previews. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to what the future holds for the VCSA."

That may seem like a quick solution, but not always the best. What if the reinstall provides the same results, then you‚Äôre back to square one. I wanted to troubleshoot and confirm my setup was correct. This validation would help in case I ran into this issue again.  Checked DNS entries are correct.  Necessary firewall ports are open. Check the VMware‚Äôs documentation for the required firewall ports.  Verified network communication from vCenter SSO and VIO management-server. This was done by validating by IP and FQDN (forward and reverse lookup).  Verify that you have used the correct syntax when adding your SSO during the VIO install.  Of course the obvious, review the logs (installer.log).After going through these troubleshooting steps and not finding anything, I decided to uninstall VIO and reinstall. Not only will you have to uninstall VIO but there is also some clean up required. This ensures that the VIO plugin is removed from the vSphere web client prior to re-installing.Uninstalling VIO Correctly  Shutdown the VIO vAPP and delete from disk.  The VIO plugin remains in vCenter until its unregistered, go to https://IP or FQDN of vCenter&gt;/mob/?moid=ExtensionManger Note: The Manage Object Browser (MOB), provides visibility to both ESXi and vCenter‚Äôs object runtime information via web browser.  Accept the untrusted cert, if not using self signed cert.  If prompted to login, use the administrator account same as the vSphere web client, for example administrator@vsphere.local.   Under the methods section click on Unregister Extension. A pop-up window will open for Unregister Extension.   Under the properties section expand out the values by clicking on more. Before Expanding  After Expanding   Unregister OpenStack extensions which include the following: com.vmware.openstack.vcext.instance-# org.openstack.compute com.vmware.openstack.ui org.os.vmw.plugin Note: There could be several vcext.instances depending on how many times you tried to install VIO without removing the plugin. Before Unregister Extension  After Unregister Extension   Once the extension is removed, refresh the MOB and the extension is removed. Rinse and repeat until all the OpenStack extensions have been removed from the MOB.  Logout and back in the vSphere web client and the VIO plugin should no longer be available.As you can see removing the vApp is only part of the process. Redeploying without properly removing the VIO plugin from the vSphere web client will result in the same error or potentially others. This method can be used to uninstall other plugins from the vSphere web client as well. Make sure you know which extensions to remove or else you could cause more harm than good. After going through this process I was able to re-install VIO without any issues."

    "content": "In a perfect datacenter environment, we would all have an additional area for Dev/Test. This is not always the case and we don‚Äôt always have the resources readily available to us. Most of us get creative using what old equipment we have. Some carve out a section in their infrastructure, while others leverage the cloud. Currently I‚Äôve been using Ravello as my Dev/Test area of my lab for VIO. A VIO production-ready deployment requires a significant amount of resources. These same resources may not be instantly available in some environments. The current deployment architecture of VIO requires 15 VMs with a total of 56CPUs and 192GB RAM; details can be found here. This doesn‚Äôt take into account if you‚Äôre using NSX. However, there are a few ways you can be conservative with VIO resources. Let me state up front: the following setup is not supported by VMware for production.Changing VIO Configuration SettingsOpen the VIO management-server console or use SSH. In the example below I‚Äôll be using SSH to make configuration changes.Login using the viouser account.The file that needs to be modified is omjs.properties, located in /opt/vmware/vio/etc.Important: Create a backup of the omjs.properties file prior to making any changes.‚Äúcp omjs.properties bak-omjs.properties‚ÄùEdit omjs.properties, in this example I‚Äôm using the VI editor.Here is the initial omjs.properties.The changes made were to the CPU, Memory, and vSphere settings section.Note: When doing the math only the first 8 entries count for CPU and Memory. The oms.vmsize.cpu.smoke and oms.vmsize.memory.smoke are currently not used. They could be place holders for future use.Save the changes and restart the management-server.Important: The omjs.properties settings will be reverted to its original state when applying a VIO update.Using Ravello for my VIO lab (part 1 and part 2), I‚Äôve been able to manage with this setup. Keep in mind the above configuration is not supported by VMware. This should only be for Dev/Test deployments with limited resources. If resources are available, I would recommend staying with the default setup. Another alternative is shutting down some of the highly available VIO VMs, this solution is also not supported in production. To save on resources use this alternative method in conjunction with editing the omjs.properties. There you have it: two ways to save on resources."

    "content": "Previously, we talked about the prerequisites (link) needed for a successful VIO deployment. Now that we‚Äôve met them, let‚Äôs take things to the next level and deploy VIO. VIO is available at no cost to those who have purchased the following VMware licensing:  vCloud Suite (all editions).  vSphere with Operations Management Enterprise Plus (vSOM).  vSphere Enterprise Plus.‚ÄúAt no cost‚Äù means you‚Äôre entitled to download and use VIO, but support from VMware is not included. While support isn‚Äôt required, it‚Äôs recommend in case you need to troubleshoot with VMware. Support can be purchased on a per CPU basis, for more information take a look at the VIO FAQ page.Downloading VIOIf you don‚Äôt have one of the VMware licenses that give you access to VIO, the other option is to download a 60 day evaluation from this link (a My VMware account is required).Under the Product Downloads tab, click Download.Go to the License &amp; Download tab, and click Manually Download to download the VIO OVA.Ravello VIO LabThe Visio-like canvas in Ravello is a nice touch in my opinion. One feature that helps from a logical perspective, is called Group. As the feature states, Group allows the grouping of VMs. Once VMs are in a group, options can be set on the entire group. These include start, stop, restart, power off, and delete. You still have the option of controlling individual VMs within the group. To see the options, click on a particular VM. Options will vary depending on whether the VMs is powered on.A Group is not static once created, you can add or subtract VMs as needed. Other group settings include providing a name and selecting a pretty color. Also you‚Äôre not limited to just creating a single group. In my case I have a Management Cluster group and a Compute Cluster group.Another feature that makes Ravello simple to use is Networking. Provide either a static IP or DHCP address, and see the magic happen from the network tab. This includes a visual mapping of the network for you. There is also the option of using an Elastic IP repository.Other settings include: VM start order, Application Scheduling, and Blueprint.VM start order allows the stop and start order of VMs within an application. For example if you have a three tier application you can control the boot order and shutdown of the VMs within the application.Application Scheduling controls the start and stop of an application. For example if you want to schedule an application to start on every week on Wednesday at 2pm and stop at 5pm.Blueprint allows you to save your configuration as a template. This template can then be redeployed several times in parallel. You can share with individuals or groups. If you publish your application in one cloud (Amazon or Google) and would like to change to another, a blueprint can help do that.Note: Some cloud providers will charge by the hour. For example if you run your VM(s) for 10 minutes and then shut it down, the bill will be for an entire hour, not the use time of 10 minutes. This is not a Ravello limitation, but based on how most cloud providers charge. So use your time wisely.Deploying VIO OVA   Create a folder under VM and templates view, mine is called VIO.   Right click on the Mgmt Cluster and select Deploy OVF Template.   Browse to the location of the VIO OVA and click Next.   Review the details of the VIO OVA and click Next.   Accept the EULA and click Next.   Enter a name that will be used for the VIO vApp and select the deployment folder. Click Next.   Select the storage location for the VIO OVA, disk format, and storage policy. Click Next.   Select the network the VIO manager will be connected to. vCenter should also have access to this network. Click Next.   Input all the properties values for the VIO OVA deployment. One value to pay close attention to is the VC SSO Lookup Service. When using vSphere 5.5 the SSO port of 7444 is required, which is not for vSphere 6.0. vSphere 5.5 ‚Äì https://vCenter FQDN or IP:7444/lookupservice/sdk vSphere 6.0 ‚Äì https://vCenter FQDN or IP/lookupservice/sdk Note: If SSO configuration is not correct here, it will cause issues when configuring VIO.   Validate the vService bindings and click Next.  Review settings, check power on after deployment, and click Finish.  Verify the VMware Integrated OpenStack icon appears on the home page of the Web Client. If the Icon is not present then log out and back in the Web Client.Power On If you attempt to power on the VIO management-server outside of the vApp, the following message will appear. Click No and power on the vApp.Note: Since I‚Äôm deploying VIO on Ravello, running nested ESXi hosts the following error was encountered. To resolve this follow the instructions in VMware KB 2108724.SummaryAt this point you should have the VIO OVA deployed, the vAPP powered on, and see the VMware Integrated OpenStack icon in the home page of the vSphere Web Client. The next few blog posts will cover configuring VIO and errors I encountered."

    "content": "The past few months I have been getting more familiar with OpenStack. By now it should be obvious that OpenStack will not be going away anytime soon, so it‚Äôs time to embrace it. Yes, I‚Äôm talking to you VMware admins!DevStack is a quick way to get started, having all the components required to deploy OpenStack in a single VM. This type of deployment is great for labs that have minimal resources, or for development environments. For a production environment, DevStack is not the deployment you‚Äôre looking for. But don‚Äôt worry, from the same folks who bought you vSphere now comes VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO). VIO provides an easy familiar deployment type for VMware admins using an OVA. The deployment is resource intensive, but you will get a highly available OpenStack environment. This environment will be able to access VMware features, such as DRS, HA, and vMotion. Let‚Äôs jump in and see how VIO is deployed and configured.Prerequisites  vSphere 5.5 update 2 or vSphere 6.0 Enterprise Plus.  ESXi host(s) with eight or more CPUs.  Management cluster of at least three hosts with 56 CPUs &amp; 192GB of RAM.  665GB of storage for NSX deployment or 585GB for vDS deployment (separate license required for NSX).  Compute cluster with at least one host and 20GB of storage.  vCenter &amp; ESXi hosts must use the same NTP server.Deployment of VIO takes place in two stages. First, the management cluster. The 15 virtual machines that make up the VIO components / services live here. Second, is the compute cluster. Deployment and management of tenant workloads take place here. As I go through the VIO deployment process I‚Äôll go into more detail with each step. I‚Äôll also try to explain more of the OpenStack terminology as it relates to the VMware administrator.Ravello Lab EnvironmentThe great folks at Ravello were kind enough to give me access to try out their product. They‚Äôre the perfect solution for labs, dev, and test environments. They already have a large library of VMs to choose from, all that‚Äôs required are the ISOs. All you need to do is drag and drop the VM type from the library to the canvas. Configuring a VM is done by simply selecting a VM and going through the configuration tabs on the right hand side (General, System, Disk, Network, and Services). Once your changes are saved, update the configuration and you‚Äôre ready to start your VM.If the VM you‚Äôre looking for is not in the library, you have the ability to create it or add your own. The library has an Empty VM that can be used to create a new VM type, and you‚Äôll have the ability to save it later. You can also upload your existing VMs, ISOs, QCOW, and OVFs using their upload tool. I uploaded an ISO for ESXi and Windows Server for management. My storage VM and VIO OVA will be uploaded to my MGMT-VM for deployment to vCenter.My Ravello configuration consists of the following:  vSphere 6.0  3 hosts for a management cluster  2 hosts for a compute cluster  1 MGMT-VM running vCentervCenter PrepBefore deploying VIO, make sure your vCenter server configuration meets the deployment standards for VIO.[While a dedicated vCenter server is recommended, VIO can be deployed leveraging your existing vCenter server].  Create a datacenter for your VIO deployment.  Note: Don‚Äôt use any special characters in your datacenter name such as commas.    Create a dedicated management cluster with at least three hosts.  Note: Although not supported, you can get away with two hosts for POC / Lab environments.  Attach datastore(s) to the management cluster for deployment of VIO VMs, also for use with glance (image service).  Create a dedicated compute cluster with at least one host.  Attach datastore(s) to the compute cluster for deployment of instances (virtual machines).  Network options include using VDS or NSX (comparison can be found here):Note: Network type of vDS or NSX must be decided prior to VIO deployment as you will see once one is selected there is no way to change without a redeploy.VDS   Create a VDS.  Add hosts in the Management and Compute cluster.  Create a Management and API Access port group, and tag each with a VLAN ID for their respective network.NSX  If you‚Äôre using NSX, create a dedicated cluster for Edge nodes (provide DHCP, routing, and floating IP addresses).  Create a separate VDS for Management, Compute, and Edge.  Create a management port group on each VDS (Management, Edge, and Compute), and tag them with the VLAN ID assigned to the Management network.  Create the API Access port group on the Management VDS, and tag it with the VLAN ID assigned to the API Access network.  Create an External Network port group on the Edge VDS, and tag it it with the VLAN ID assigned to the External network.Stage 1: Management Cluster ConfigurationThis is where your VIO deployment takes place, more on that in a later post.   Enable Hosts VT BIOS setting   Enable vSphere DRS: Manage ‚Äì&gt; Settings ‚Äì&gt; Services ‚Äì&gt; vSphere DRS.  Steps 3-7 are all done under vSphere HA settings.  Enable Host Monitoring: Manage ‚Äì&gt; Settings ‚Äì&gt; Services ‚Äì&gt; vSphere HA. Note: Host Monitoring was turned on by default, but it‚Äôs always good to verify.   Enable Admission Control: Manage ‚Äì&gt; Settings ‚Äì&gt; Services ‚Äì&gt; vSphere HA ‚Äì&gt; Admission Control.   Set VM restart priority to High: Manage ‚Äì&gt; Settings ‚Äì&gt; Services ‚Äì&gt; vSphere HA ‚Äì&gt; Failure conditions and VM response ‚Äì&gt; VM restart priority.   Set VM Monitoring to VM and Application Monitoring: Manage ‚Äì&gt; Setting ‚Äì&gt; Services ‚Äì&gt; vSphere HA ‚Äì&gt; Virtual Machine Monitoring.   Set Monitoring sensitivity to High: Manage ‚Äì&gt; Settings ‚Äì&gt; Services ‚Äì&gt; vSphere HA ‚Äì&gt; Failure conditions and VM response ‚Äì&gt; VM monitoring and sensitivity.   Enable vMotion and Fault Tolerance Logging: Add new VMkernel port for vMotion.   Enable vMotion and Fault Tolerance for Management Network VMkernel port: Host ‚Äì&gt; Manage ‚Äì&gt; Networking ‚Äì&gt; VMkernel Adapters. Stage 2: Compute Cluster ConfigurationRinse and repeat for the compute cluster, settings should mirror the Management cluster above. Your tenants will take residency here!SummaryUsing Ravello for my VIO lab was easy to set up and saved me time from having to free up resources in my home lab. I also enjoyed having external access to my environment via RDP for my management VM or SSH to my ESXi hosts. Now I have an environment that meets the VIO prerequisites and can proceed with the deployment. I will cover the deployment in the next post as well as some of the errors that I ran across in hopes of saving you time. Stay tuned!"

    "content": "Your boss has requested that you look at OpenStack and what it would take to install it into your environment. One of the requirements is to leverage your current VMware infrastructure. Of course your plate is already full, and now you need to learn a new platform. Here are a few things that should ease your mind when considering OpenStack. First, OpenStack is a framework that can use your current hardware and software infrastructure. Second, OpenStack services allow integration at the software layer with vendors like VMware. Finally, OpenStack uses drivers to translate requests to calls on the software infrastructure. Why is this important? Let‚Äôs take a look at VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) to answer these questions.VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO)At this point you probably have some questions similar to the following:  What is VIO?  How does it integrate with my current vSphere environment?  Why should I use VIO instead of running OpenStack on RHEL, KVM, etc?  Who should use VIO?First lets focus on VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) and what it is. Simply put VIO allows the use of OpenStack framework on your current VMware vSphere infrastructure. OpenStack services have VMware specific drivers and plugins built to translate requests to calls.Deploying VIO consists of a virtual appliance (vApp) to your vCenter. The vApp deploys two VMs: management-server (OMS) and openstack-template. The management VM deploys, configures, and manages VIO. The OpenStack template VM has the base images for the VIO VMs. A plugin is available in vCenter that will allow the deployment of a highly available OpenStack production environment. This environment will consist of 15 VMs:  VIO Compute Driver ‚Äì this is the Nova compute node(s) which handle deploying and deleting instances. Each vSphere cluster added to OpenStack will add a Nova compute node, otherwise it starts with one.  VIO Controller ‚Äì The OpenStack APIs and schedulers live here. Services consist of Nova, Neutron, Glance, Cinder, Heat and Keystone. Two controller VMs are deployed in an Active / Active configuration.  VIO DB ‚Äì This is where the metadata lives. There are 3 MariaDB VMs deployed in an Active/ Passive / Passive state with replication between the databases.  VIO DHCP ‚Äì Manages tenant IP addresses. Two VMs in an active / active state.  VIO LoadBalancer ‚Äì Internal and external communication is handled by two load balancers in an active / passive state.  VIO Memcache ‚Äì Are memory stores for database call results. Two initials active / active VMs are deployed but it‚Äôs scalable.  VIO Objectstorage ‚Äì Allows storage and retrieval of data, also known as Swift. Initially 1 VM is deployed.  VIO RabbitMQ ‚Äì communication between services are handled by messaging. Two RabbitMQ VMs are deployed both are active.Now that you have an basic understanding of what VIO is and its components lets move on to how it integrates with vSphere. VIO sits on top of your current vSphere infrastructure. Once VIO has been deployed and configured on vSphere it leverages the following:  Compute clusters managed via Nova. VIO manages the resources at the cluster level not the individual host level.  Neutron (Networking) can leverage your current vDS or NSX via NSX plugin.  OpenStack Manager (OMS) allows addition of components such as compute, storage, etc post deployment.  vCenter driver and Cinder driver is used to connect the OpenStack services with vSphere.  vSphere Web Client plug-in is available for management. All instance deployment and management should be done from the Horizon web portal or OpenStack API.  Glance images can be either a VMDK, OVA, or ISO.Do you spreken the OpenStack lingo?Usually when learning something new, one must be prepared to take on a new vocabulary as it relates to that subject. OpenStack is no different, using code names as it relates to these terms. Here is just a quick cheat sheet to get you up to speed and help you understand when you hear someone mention any of the OpenStack terms.[table id=5 /]Using VIO with vDS ‚Äìvs- NSXVIO supports vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS) or NSX via the Neutron plugin. Although supported, the vDS has limitations in a VIO environment compared to NSX. NSX can provide support for options such as security groups and fenced environments via Firewall. Here is a quick comparison:vDS  VLANs for Provider Networks  Layer 2 Support  Management Plane High AvailabilityNSX  VLANs for Provider Networks  Layer 2 and 3 Support  NAT &amp; Floating IP Support  Security Groups  DHCP Service  Stateful distributed FirewallThe Benefits of VIOVIO should not be mistaken for a VMware proprietary flavor of OpenStack, it in fact is based on a VMware OpenStack distribution recognized by the OpenStack Foundation. There are benefits for deploying VIO compared to using KVM or RHEL:  VMware administrators will not be as intimidated to learn OpenStack since they are all ready familiar with the underlying infrastructure.  Ease of deployment with a vAPP. More importantly it deploys a highly available production ready environment.  Free to customers who own the vCloud suite &amp; vSphere with Operations Management (vSOM).  One stop shop for support. VMware will provide support for OpenStack and VMware infrastructure. This will come at a cost of $200 per CPU. Keep in mind that VMware is eating it‚Äôs own dog food here and running a large OpenStack deployment internally using VIO on vSphere.  Ease of management such as adding or removing capacity.  Leveraging benefits of the vSphere environment such as DRS, HA, and vMotion.  Simplified upgrades and patching with the potential of minimum disruption to the OpenStack environment. This would depend on the underlying infrastructure.  Integration with other VMware products such as log insight and vRealize Operations manager.  Support for any storage supported by vSphere infrastructure including VSAN.  Developers have an area to spin up virtual machines for development and testing.OpenStack is usually thought of as hard to implement; VIO simplifies that. VIO allows VMware administrators to get familiar with OpenStack quicker while leveraging their current vSphere environment, also giving developers an area to code and operations a test area without looking elsewhere causing shadow IT. As organizations get more familiar with OpenStack over time they can also begin to contribute. Stay tuned as we‚Äôll go more in to the deployment and configuration of VIO on vSphere 6."

    "content": "Time travel has always been a fascinating concept in our society. Think of the possibilities with the ability to move forward or backwards in time. There even is the idea of an alternate universe. The concept of time travel is so huge that we have several books, TV shows, and movies based on it. If only we had a time machine, like in Back to the Future! The latest release of Tintri‚Äôs OS 3.2 includes several new features. SyncVM is one them. The new SyncVM feature lets you experience time travel via your VMs. SyncVM leverages snapshot capabilities to move back and forth in time. This can be at the VM level. SyncVM also lets you propagate changes at a vDisk level from one VM to a set of VMs.Disclaimer: I am a Tintri employee, this post is based on my experience and not a requirement by my employer.The beauty of SyncVM is that physical data is not moved. Instead it leverages snapshots, SyncVM allows movement between different points in time (aka time travel). This is not possible with traditional snapshots. SyncVM includes a preventive measure that creates a SyncVM safety snapshot. This is a safety precaution: a snapshot taken prior to the data synchronization and is selectable from the snapshot dropdown list.The SyncVM feature doesn‚Äôt cause any loss of snapshots or performance data within vCenter. Also no storage or VM reconfiguration takes place. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, let‚Äôs explore a few use cases where SyncVM will be beneficial.Development and Test environmentsData management in a dev or test environment can be a challenge to maintain across a number of VMs. These VMs can span separate environments such as development, QA, and production. The diagram below illustrates two types of environments. The one on the left utilizes scripts to maintain the data between each environment, while the environment on the right is leveraging SyncVM capabilities.Scripts require maintenance and time. They may also not be scalable to move between other environments, not to mention the clutter that comes from having to keep several scripts available or up to date. SyncVM eliminates the need for all these dependencies and guess work. It provides a dynamic and scalable way of refreshing your data between environments. This can also be useful for other environments such as labs, kiosks, demos, and file servers.DatabasesDevelopment and troubleshooting of databases really benefit from SyncVM. In the case of applications that require a database, use SyncVM to have either an offline copy or an isolated copy on a different network (VLAN). Another benefit of using SyncVM with databases is updates or patches. Keep in mind since this is all at the VM level, we can use SyncVM on the vDisk level as well. The vDisk recovery feature provides the ability to sync database files and logs to other database servers.vDisk RecoveryvDisk recovery can sync data at the disk level. You can have up to 20 destination VMs (at a time) syncing from 1 source VM. The vDisk containing the operating system can have dependencies, so be aware of them prior to attempting a refresh. What if you only want to recover a single or a handful of files, is it possible? The answer is Yes! This requires mounting a separate vDisk to your destination VM, recovering all files to that particular vDisk, and copying the ones you actually need to another vDisk. Think of this as a quick alternative file recovery method.Getting started with SyncVM ‚Äì Restore VMSyncVM has two capabilities: Restore VM and Refresh virtual disks. The Restore VM allows the refresh of data from any point in time on any individual VM. This point in time can be from an hour ago, days, or weeks. The flexibility SyncVM provides is the ability to move between any point in time, forwards or backwards.  Select a VM, right click and choose Restore VM. You can leverage an existing VM snapshot or create a new one.  Note: At least one snapshot (manual or scheduled) must be available on the selected VM.   Select a snapshot to restore from.   Click Restore. In a few clicks you have restored data to a VM with the ability to select any point in time.Getting started with SyncVM ‚Äì Refresh Virtual DisksThe second functionality that SyncVM provides is Refresh Virtual Disk. We can now select up to 20 destination VMs at a time and refresh a particular vDisk from any source VM in your environment.  Select 1-20 VMs, right click and choose Refresh virtual disks.   Select the VM, Snapshot, and vDisk to refresh from dropdown(s). Click Refresh.   Acknowledge completed synchronization. These are just a few use cases with SyncVM. Disaster Recovery has potential use case as well, we‚Äôll leave that for another post. If you‚Äôre a fan of scripting, Tintri‚Äôs REST API or PowerShell toolkit is also available. Stay tuned for more use cases and automation goodness around SyncVM."

There is an explanation of which exams to take and request for the beta authorization. The VCP6-DCV now requires two exams: VCP6-Foundation &amp; VCP6-DCV. The exception to this rule is if you are currently a VCP. Current VCPs can choose to take one exam. Which includes the VCP6-DCV Delta or the VCP6-DCV. It looks like the difference between exams is number of questions. The Delta is only 75 questions compared to 100 questions for the other exams. If your VCP has expired then its two exams for you. This information is under the Migration Paths tab. There is also a Testimonials tab and FAQ tab but with limited information as of today.There is currently no word on how long the beta will be available. I will say it does come at a nice price point of $50 no matter which exam(s) you take. With the beta exam you only get one shot and if failed then you must wait until the exam is GA. No scores will be provided, only pass or failed. Hopefully the blueprint will be downloadable once the exam is GA. Exam authorization takes roughly 15mins. All the exams are currently proctored. There is currently no word yet if the Delta or any other exam will have the option of being taken from home like the VCP5-DCV Delta exam. Keep in mind that if you have a VCAP, taking and passing the VCIX exam you will get the VCP6-DCV as well. Good luck for those who plan on taking the exam. I‚Äôm sure more details in regards to this beta will be available soon. Especially after the VCIX exams become available."

    "content": "During my career I have had the opportunity to work as both a customer and partner. As a customer I worked for large enterprise environments. I did design, implementation, and troubleshooting. This was great but was all done within a silo, with a limited scope. When I went to work for a partner things changed. I got to see different environments and had to develop a different mind set. I got exposure and access to tools and portals that I wouldn‚Äôt have as a customer. Also there was more focus on learning and training. In each role I developed new skills and grew. I also had the opportunity to work and learn from a lot of amazing people.So why am I writing this? I will be adding vendor to that list. Starting next week, I will be starting a new role at Tintri as a Technical Marketing Engineer. This role will allow me to continue to expand my thirst for knowledge. I will continue to work with the VMware suite of products, but also expand. The opportunity to work with service providers, other hypervisors, and applications, but also dive deeper. I will also be writing white papers, reference architectures, and blogging. I plan to keep my personal blog separate, but this will allow me other opportunities for more and unique content. Also this will not affect my activities with vBrownBag.It doesn‚Äôt stop there. This role is based at the Tintri headquarters in Mountain View, California. So you guessed it, I will be relocating to the Bay Area. I‚Äôm looking forward to this new exciting adventure that this role and move will bring.Leaving the team at GDT was the hardest part of this decision. I got to work with a lot of amazing people. I‚Äôm thankful for my time there and the experience.I also want to take this opportunity to thank the community. Getting involved with my local VMUG and then vBrownBag has helped me grow and get out of my comfort zone.Wish me luck!"

    "content": "The VCSA 6.0 has two deployment types, guided and scripted. The scripted deployment is now simplified. You are now provided several templates, 5 to be exact. Now You don‚Äôt have to just use the default templates you can add to them or even create your own. Getting started is not that hard; once all the necessary information is available. The templates are usable from a command prompt or PowerShell. Let‚Äôs walk through how to use both.TemplatesFirst let me start by saying the provided templates are in a JSON format. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. This format is easy to read and write. In my opinion this one of the reason the scripted deployment is now simplified. OK, this is all great but where are the templates? The default templates are in the vcsa-cli-installer directory under templates of the VCSA ISO.Note: Screenshots ‚Äì Mac on the top / Windows on the bottom. Here are the 5 available templates and their descriptions:  Embedded ‚Äì deploys a vCenter server with an embedded platform services controller.  Full Conf ‚Äì template used by vCenter Server Appliance CLI installer.  PSC ‚Äì deploys a Platform Services Controller.  PSC Replication ‚Äì deploys a Platform Services Controller which joins an existing SSO domain.  VC ‚Äì deploys a vCenter Server.In order to understand the templates, let‚Äôs take a look at the help. The templates help option can be opened by using a command prompt or PowerShell session with administrator rights.Command Line helpUnder the vcsa-cli-installer directory there are three OS directories: Win32, Mac, and Lin64. Select the proper directory based on your OS and use the vcsa-deploy. The examples below show both Mac and Windows.Mac = vcsa-cli-installer\\mac\\vcsa-deploy Win = vcsa-cli-installer\\win32\\vcsa-deployThere are more options in the command line for template parameters using ‚Äì‚Äìtemplate ‚Äìh. Here is a quick breakdown:  Networking  SSO  System  Database  DeploymentPowerShell HelpJust like the command line option. Point to the vcsa-deploy in the win32 directory..\\vcsa-cli-installer\\win32\\vcsa-deploy -h .\\vcsa-cli-installer\\win32\\vcsa-deploy ‚Äì‚Äìtemplate ‚ÄìhIn this example I will be using is take the embedded.example.json template and customize it. Things to keep in mind:  Make sure both forward and reverse DNS are in place.  Only use one DNS entry in the template, installer fails with multiple entries.  Unless otherwise specified the defaults will be an embedded database and PSC.  There are some optional parameters that can be used with templates.  SSO authenticated domain doesn‚Äôt need to be vSphere.local, make sure it‚Äôs not the same as LDAP domain name.The template on the top is the original template provided on the VCSA ISO, bottom is the customized template based on the original. Now that the template has been modified, it‚Äôs time to run it using either command line or PowerShell. In this example I will be using the windows command line.Deploying from Template  Open a command prompt with administrator rights.  Navigate to the vcsa-deploy directory of corresponding to your OS (win32, mac, lin64)  Add the path to the template you wish to run (location of your template).  Press Enter and behold the magically deployment,Once the template is deployed, it will power on and start installing services. Deploying from template took roughly 15-20 minutes to complete.Log in the Web Client using https://VCSA FQDN or IP/vsphere-client using the administrator credentials you supplied in the template.That‚Äôs it in a nut shell, of course there is a lot more you can do. This will definitely get you started. Scripted deployments will help those who have multiple VCSA and PSC in their environment. This is also a good way to automate and stay consistent with your deployments."

    "content": "VMware Software Manager ‚Äì Download Service 1.0 release coincides with the launch of vSphere 6.0. This tool is to assist with the download management of VMware products. It‚Äôs an easy button to download all the bits for a particular suite or individual products. The download catalog is currently limited to the following Datacenter and Cloud infrastructure products:  VMware vCloud Suite 6.0, 5.8, and 5.5  VMware vSphere w/ Operations Management 6.0 and 5.5  VMware vSphere 6.0, 5.5, and 5.1There is a detection mechanism that is aware when a new suite, product, and version are available. Another benefit is an integrity check that validates all downloads. The Software Manager ‚Äì Download Service has the following requirements:Operating Systems  Windows 8.1 64-bit  Windows 7 64-bit SP2  Windows Server 2012 64-bit R2  Windows Server 2008 64-bit R2 SP1Supported Browsers  Internet Explorer 10 and 11  Firefox 34 and 35  Google Chrome 39 and 40The installation and setup is simple and requires minimal time. The MSI is close to 17mb in in size and can be found here. The installation also requires a location for the software depot. The minimal requirement for the software depot is 80GB. Along with each product is the download size which will assist in determining the necessary size for your software depot. I would recommend a separate disk that can be allocated to your software depot to be used as a central repository.Installation  Click Next on the VMware Software Manager ‚Äì Download Service Setup.   Accept the EULA and click Next.   Select the install and depot locations. Click Next. Note: Install depot on separate disk to provide flexibility for disk expansion and potential central repository.   Click Install.   It‚Äôs off to the races, install process is fairly quick.  Note: Depending on your Windows User Account Control Setting (UAC), you may receive a prompt to allow the MSI to install. Click Yes to proceed.   Click Finish. Note: Check box for open download service web application is set by default. Interface  Log in the Software Manager ‚Äì Download Service using your My VMware account. Click Connect or press Enter.   The first login requires initialization, which takes a minute.   Select category, suite, version, and edition under software. Download will display what is being and has been downloaded, consider it your current status and history. Note: To log out click the Disconnect button in the upper right hand corner.   Each suite or product displays the required size on disk.   Each suite can be expanded to display the related products and a download button to for the entire suite. If you would prefer to download an individual product expand the suite and download that product.   The Software Manager ‚Äì Download Service icon in the windows taskbar has several settings          Show the download location      Set the download location      Enable debugging information      SummaryVMware Software Manager ‚Äì Download Service is tool that allows downloading VMware products in a simple manner. There are few features I would like to see added, such as support for Mac OS X and Linux operating systems, and notifications for when new versions or downloads are available and have completed. Some other helpful features would be proxy settings for those environments that require it, and download of plugins for those products that have them available. This is a great start for a new 1.0 tool, and I am looking forward to seeing how the product will evolve."

    "content": "Home labs come with many benefits. From learning new technologies, studying for certifications, testing and more. They also come with a cost unless you have sponsors or a lab sugar daddy, these fees come out of your pocket and they can add up.  First is the up-front cost of purchasing the basic hardware, new or used. Depending on the your hardware requirements up-front costs can be high.  Second is the added cost of power. Hamsters don‚Äôt power your lab!  Third is the added cost of cooling your lab, unless you want to boil yourself with all of that powered hardware running at capacity. This has many factors depending on location within your home or co-location. However, I break this out at its own point as I‚Äôve experienced labs set up by people who didn‚Äôt know they needed to have a cooling element. Don‚Äôt be those people.  Fourth is software &amp; licensing costs.After these costs factors above, over time you need to maintain your lab environment. As technology evolves, your hardware becomes obsolete or unsupported. This constant evolution necessitates ongoing upgrades. Also, keep in mind, new versions of software can also play a role in when you decide to upgrade your hardware. You can recoup some costs by selling your old hardware, but don‚Äôt expect to get too much.There are other costs associated with a home lab but you get the picture. Are there alternatives to learning without having a home lab? Of course there are and with these costs in mind I decided to write about some of the options you have for learning. Some of these options are free, while others are not.Learning StylesEveryone learns at their own pace and in their own unique way. There‚Äôs really no standard approach, it‚Äôs what works best for you. There are those who are visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or a combination of these learning types. Here is a breakdown of these learning types.  Auditory Learners ‚Äì Learns best by listening and associates sounds. These can be lectures, podcasts, discussions, or presentations.  Visual Learners ‚Äì Learns effectively by watching or writing. These can videos, diagrams, or reading.  Kinesthetic Learners ‚Äì Learns best hands-on. These can be labs, on the job scenarios, interactive demos, or simulator(s).Once you have figured out what learning type works for you, next is to determine your interaction. These could be related to your personality. Do you learn best in groups or alone? It‚Äôs also possible that it could be a combination of the two depending on situation.  Interpersonal ‚Äì Learns in groups or with other people.  Intrapersonal ‚Äì Prefers to learn alone.Alternatives to Home LabHere we go, this is what you have been waiting for.Online Hosted Labs ‚Äì In my opinion, hosted labs are a great quick way to getting started learning products(s). No setup required on your part which is a big plus. They are already too catered for a particular environment or product. Typically some sort of guide is associated with these labs. Using the guide throughout the lab helps understand the product(s) and how it works. With that said, always feel free to go exploring and to break things. These are both great ways to learn. One downside to hosted labs is that they are typically not updated quickly.Online Communities / Forums ‚Äì Most products have some sort of online community or forum. Here you can ask or view questions and provide or review answers. This is a great way to show your knowledge of a product(s) while learning since you will come across different environments and scenarios. Communities or forums sometimes provide incentives such as points or status. I am not really to keen on those but it could be a motivational tool for others.Local Groups / Meetups ‚Äì If you like human interaction, then this is for you! Local groups and meetups allow individuals to connect with other members within your community with various backgrounds with a common interest. What better way to learn and network all at the same time. VMware User Group (VMUG) and Virtualization Technology User Group (VTUG) are examples of these local groups. Use a site like Meetup.com to find other groups that deal with your interests such as OpenStack, programming languages, networking, etc.Mentor(s) ‚Äì If you are aspiring for certain career goals or wanting to excel at various technologies, a mentor(s) is something to consider. Having someone in your corner to provide guidance as it relates to experience and knowledge. Mentors are also a good sounding board, allowing you to discuss and bounce ideas while learning. There are also benefits to being a mentor. Mentors are considered leaders, which helps affirm of your competence, and is a good way to give back to the community.Social Media / Blogs ‚Äì There is no limitation on the number of resources available and those who produce it. Blogs are an excellent resource since they usually come from those working in the field and their experiences. RSS feeds are good way to keep up with your favorite blogger as well. When it comes to social media, tools like Twitter and Google + are a good place to start. Yes, I call them tools, especially if they are used correctly. Social media is a way to interact by asking and answering questions, but also a way to interact and get to know others. Keep in mind that anything you do or say is visible so be mindful and respectful of others.Vendor Sites ‚Äì Vendor sites usually have documentation, videos, and other materials for their products on their sites. This is a good way to research and learn about the company and products.Online Training ‚Äì Provides a great way of viewing material at your own pace from the comfort of your home or anywhere for that matter. Companies like Pluralsight have provided a lot of great content at an affordable price.Simulators ‚Äì Simulators can be very useful tools to learn most of a products features. They can also serve as test platforms for updates, scripts, migrations, etc without the fear of affecting your production environment and causing a resume generating event. Check with your product vendor if they offer a simulator or virtual appliance that can be used for testing.Type 2 Hypervisors ‚Äì Are hosted hyperviors on an operating system. While this can be resource intensive, it‚Äôs a great way to get started with learning not only virtualization but applications, scritpting, other operating system, etc. Several companies have these platforms available for free with limitation or for a reasonable price. VMware offers Workstation and Fusion, but also a free version of Player. Oracle has virtual box that is also a free option. Another option to consider when running a type 2 hypervisor is using AutoLab. AutoLab is a quick way to run a lab environment within your Workstation or Fusion environments.Conferences ‚Äì While there is a bigger cost associated with attending a conference, there are many benefits. First is the amount of training sessions available. These are often available form beginner to expert levels. Don‚Äôt get overwhelmed with having to attend all the sessions, most conferences now offer all the session online for attendees. Second is the networking aspect, which is very beneficial. Connecting with peers and meeting new ones allows you to grow your circle of technology and share cool stories. Third is the opportunity to meet and discuss with subject matter experts. These can range from presenters, engineers, or developers. Finally the opportunity to dive in any labs that are available as they are typically offered first at the conferences.Public Cloud ‚Äì This one is both beneficial yet can be very costly. Deploying a lab environment in the cloud definitely has many benefits such as not worrying about hardware or any upgrades associate with them. Getting started is fairly quick and in no time you can start spinning virtual servers from anywhere. Of course, this comes at a price. Some providers charged per minute based on how long a virtual machine is powered on or based on if VMs are deployed. Make sure you read the fine print for this one. Some available options are Amazon‚Äôs AWS service, VMware‚Äôs vCloud Air, Microsoft Azure, just to name a few. There are also new players in town like Ravello, who use nested virtualization and allow you to move workloads from VMware, Amazon, or Google across to their platform.Alternative Lab Examples A small summary of available free and paid for resources to use for your learning pleasure.VMware  VMware Hands On Labs (HOL)  VMware Product Walkthroughs  VMware Education Instructor Led Videos  VMware Self Paced eLearning  VMware Webinars (recorded available)                              [VMware Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/7_0          PLAYER-710          product_downloads)                      VMware vSphere HypervisorMicrosoft  Microsoft Virtual Academy  Microsoft Technet Virtual Labs  Microsoft TechEd Sessions  Microsoft Press Free eBooksOpenStack  OpenStack Marketplace Training  Professional OpenStack Citrix  Free Citrix Solutions Training  XenServer  Learning Labs (Beta at time of this writing)Cisco  UCS Platform Emulator (version 3.0 1cPE1)Coding  Code Academy  w3schools  CodingBat  Khan Academy  HTML5 Rocks  Learn Python The Hard Way  Treehouse  Code Avengers  Code.orgVarious  vBrownBag  Tech Field Day  Virtual Box  Parallels  Excel Easy Update ‚Äì Added 3/31/2015  Pluralsight  CBT Nuggets  AutoLab  GNS3  Gogo Training  udemy  EMC e-Learning  NetApp University (WBT are free)SummaryThe thing to consider is that a home lab is an investment in yourself with a cost over time. It is up to you to determine if this cost outweighs using some of the other methods. If you already own a home lab these could be additions to extended it. Either way you decide, the investment will pay off. Your growth and knowledge will help you to continue to move forward. A potential increase in salary is also another benefit. Also remember to pay it forward. Helping others by teaching or guiding is another rewarding way of learning. Your progression depends on the progression of others. I‚Äôm sure that there are other options available for home lab alternatives. Please let me know some of your favorites and I‚Äôll be sure to add them to the list."

    "content": "I recently received my vExpert NFR license from Opvizor to try their health analyzer tool. For a nice overview of the install process, Michael White has a great post. There really isn‚Äôt much to the setup at all, and it is quick and easy to get up and running. Once the setup is complete, the dashboard with your VMware infrastructure info is available. Roger Lund navigates through the dashboard components in this post. What I‚Äôm really looking to focus on are Opvizor‚Äôs reporting capabilities.Reporting DashboardTo access reports from the dashboard, on the right hand side select the notebook like icon.One thing to notice is there no shortage of reports. To be exact there‚Äôre 17 default reports available ranging from Network to Issue Urgency.To view a report, select one and click generate report. Once there‚Äôs a green check mark under state, select the report type of HTML, PDF, or CSV.Some of these reports would require scripting or even another product to gather the information from your vSphere environment. Of course while all the reports in this list are helpful, it would take a rather longer blog post to demo every single one. Here are a couple examples:Security Report:  Description of the issue(s)  Provides the risk / threat related to a particular setting(s)  Negative Functional Impact  Configuration ‚Äì Current setting and how to make the necessary changes including any caveats, such as VM must be powered off. Options for making the changes (fixing) include vSphere Client, PowerCLI, or vCLI. A reference source to the best practice, one example is the vSphere Hardening Guide. In most cases a how to video is also provided.Note: The report also color coded for higher priority issues. For example an item highlighted in yellow is considered a higher priority.Inventory Report:A very detailed report of of your vSphere environment ranging from Host information down to attached VM devices. Report SettingsThere is an option to automate the delivery of the reports, since we all know that management wants them first thing Monday morning. Selecting the cog icon in the upper right hand of the reports screen, opens the reports settings window. As you can see the report settings screen is simple and straight forward.SummaryAs you can see, Opvizor comes with a great deal of standard reporting right out of the box. To add more reports, or customize them further, there are a few options. First would be submitting a request, which they call ‚Äúmake a wish‚Äù. Next is leveraging the REST APIs or PowerCLI to extract the necessary data. Finally, you can use the CSV files from various reports, and modify them to your linking. One of the features I would like to see is the ability to send multiple reports at once, so sounds like I will be submitting request, or making wish in this case. If you are a vExpert, Opvizor is providing a NFR license here, and they also have a free edition that supports one cluster. The free edition is more than enough to get started and evaluate."

    "content": "There are two industry standards when it comes to duplication. The first type is Inline which occurs as data is being written. Second is Post-Process where data is analyzed after being written. So what‚Äôs the difference to using one over the other?Note: While I recognize there are 5 billion things to keep in mind when it comes to Inline and Post-Process deduplication these are the ones that stood out to me.With Inline new blocks are only created if the data does not exist. If the data is there, new meta data will reference the existing block. Few things to keep in mind with Inline are:  A hash calculation is created in memory and stored on a storage device as data is written. This calculation has the potential of slowing down the process as data is being validated and indexed (latency).  Since blocks of data are created as needed, less storage is required.  There is CPU tax, unless you offload the process to dedicated hardware.  Less IOPS are being sent to disk.Post-Process removes duplicate data after it has been written to storage. There is a potential of having duplicate data until after the process validates. Few things to keep in mind with Post-Process are:  No hash calculation needed up front on storage device, allowing the initial write process to take less time (in theory).  Requires more storage since all data is written up front.  There is a CPU and Disk tax during the Post-Process operation more latency is introduced.  Less IOPS for applications (rereading blocks that have already been written).During Virtualization Field Day 4 we got to see how Simplivity handles deduplication, here are my notes.Disclaimer: I was a delegate at Virtualization Field Day 4. Gestalt IT paid my travel, lodging, and meals. I don‚Äôt receive any compensation nor am I required to write anything related to the event.SimpliVity has a solution to solve the issues that plague using Inline and Post-Process deduplication. The secret sauce comes from using the virtual controller (brains) coupled with software and the OmniStack Accelerator card (muscle). By the way this is all done on their own proprietary operating system (SVT). Few things to keep in mind with SimpliVity:  Less IOPS going to hard drives (typical w/ Inline).  Lower CPU &amp; memory utilization.  Lower latency on hard drive(s) doing less which allows more optimize IO.  Less IOPS are being sent to disk more are available for applications.As you can see from this simplistic (no pun intended) overview, SimpliVity provides deduplication in ways others don‚Äôt. The benefits include having the hash calculation take place on the OminStack Accelerator card instead of in memory. Meta data is separated out from data and held in pool of SSD, faster for reads. This eliminates the CPU and Disk tax as well as guaranteed IOPS for applications. This is just what they are doing with deduplication, compression gains the same benefits from the OminStack Accelerator card as well."

    "content": "It‚Äôs that time again, a new release of vSphere is upon us. Some features we‚Äôve been waiting for a while now, others are new or revamped. It‚Äôs evident that VMware has put effort into the vCenter appliance. In previous releases it was lacking several features needed to make it equal to its Windows Counterpart. Well it seems that VMware has heard the many cries, and the appliance is now, in my opinion, ready for prime time. Let‚Äôs take a look at what‚Äôs new and you decide if you will be a vCenter 6.0 appliance adopter.Dude Where‚Äôs My OVA / OVF?The first thing you‚Äôll notice when downloading the new vCenter appliance is the lack of OVA / OVF, they‚Äôre gone! Replaced now by a self contained ISO, which was typical for a windows deployment but an appliance? The ISO is 2GB in size and uses an HTML 5 based installer. It contains the following:  vCenter Binaries &amp; Installer bits  The necessary plugins for both Windows and Mac          VMware Client integration Plug-in.pkg      VMware Client Integration Plugin 6.0.exe        Binaries &amp; Templates for scripted installs  Index.html ‚Äì Appliance Guided Installer Deployment TypesFor this release of the vCSA there are only 2 supported deployment types. The first one is guided, which can be found when using the HTML 5 installer. The installer has built in validations process. The validation process takes place up front throughout the installation, assuring the targeted vSphere environment is supported and system requirements are met. Once the guided install is complete the vCSA appliance is ready for use.The second deployment type is scripted. The scripted installer allows for the automation of the vCSA deployments. The Install.exe uses a mandatory template file and several optional parameters. VMware has supplied 5 sample template files, which can be found under vCSA-CLI-Installer directory. The templates are good for various deployments including distributed. The scripted installed also has a handy help option (install.exe -h) which provides an explanation of the parameter types.Appliance AccessAfter it‚Äôs deployment there are 3 ways to access the vCSA:vSphere Web Client ‚Äì This release of the Web Client has seen improvement in regards to speed and the clumsy animation of the past. The vCSA setting can be found under System Configuration. Select the desired node and use the manage tab to make configuration changes.Appliance Shell ‚Äì The Appliance shell contains all the API commands and plugins needed for monitoring, troubleshooting and configuration of the vCSA. Access to the Appliance Shell is granted through SSH or DCUI using Alt+F1.DCUI (Direct Console User Interface) ‚Äì This is the interactive text based menu of the vCSA. From the Web Client browse to the vCSA and click the summary tab. Click Launch Console to access the DCUI.Size Does MatterOut of the box the vCenter appliance has 4 supported sizes. They range from Tiny to Large, still waiting on big gulp. You are not locked in to a particular size if you infrastructure grows. Changing the size is as simple as editing the Appliance VM.Supported Features   Support for Hardware version 11  Embedded tuned vPostgres database / Oracle for external  Linked Mode (Mix and match between windows &amp; vCSA)  IPv6 Support  SRM (Site Recovery Manager)  PowerCLI ‚Äì (Connection from a PowerCLI session)  Native Replication replaces Microsoft ADAM  Replication of Policies &amp; Tags in Link Mode  Patching (Product &amp; Security) via https://www.vmware.com/patchmgr/findPatch.portalMissing Features  100% VMware Update Manager Support  Microsoft SQL Server Support  SQL Server to vPostgres MigrationSummaryAlthough the appliance now has feature parity, there‚Äôs still a dependency on Windows. VMware Update Manager (VUM) still requires a Windows Server to install. I was hoping that we would see VUM transition to an appliance deployment as well. Another item missing is a migration path from a Windows to an Appliance vCenter. There is currently not a supported way to go from a MS SQL database to postgreSQL. While the having these options would be welcomed they are not show stoppers in considering the vCSA as the go to vCenter deployment. What are your thoughts?"

    "content": "I have to be honest, Platform9 caught me by surprise at VFD4 with what seemed to be their answer for an AWS like offering. Their approach is private clouds should be simple without the worry of large IT staffs and ROI. Their solution is delivered onto your existing infrastructure using a SaaS managed approached to OpenStack. Of course; as you read this and think no way can a private cloud utilizing OpenStack be simple. Well tell that to the folks at Platform9, because they‚Äôre doing it. Here are 10 reasons to consider:Disclaimer: I was a delegate at Virtualization Field Day 4. Gestalt IT paid my travel, lodging, and meals. I don‚Äôt receive any compensation nor am I required to write anything related to the event.1. Setup ‚Äì Platform9 Managed OpenStack takes roughly five to ten minutes from start to finish. No previous experience of OpenStack or large IT staff required. Let that sink in because you saw OpenStack and no experience needed in the same sentence.2. Infrastructure ‚Äì You can leverage your existing or new compute, storage (DAS, NFS, ISCSI), and network to create logical pools of resources. As an added bonus you can use your infrastructure from any geographical location. So far I‚Äôm impressed, but wait there‚Äôs more.3. Price ‚Äì Not only are you provided with a simple setup and the ability to leverage your own hardware but reasonable pricing and 3 tier model too! This model includes Lite, Business, and Enterprise. Lite is free, yes free and provides a way to get familiar with Platform9‚Äôs services while learning OpenStack. Can you say lab environment. Business offers a production ready competitive price point of $49 per CPU per month with an annual commitment. Definitely competitive for this type of service. Enterprise uses the same model as the Business tier, but offers the most services including 24/7 email and phone support with SSO and other features coming soon. More information can be found here4. Supported Platforms ‚Äì Platform9 wants users to care about their applications and not the platform they‚Äôre running on. Which is why their vision of private cloud must be flexible and not limited to only a single virtualization platform or hypervisor. Supporting KVM, ESXi (currently in beta), and containers with Docker (coming soon) allows them to leverage greenfield and brownfield deployments. Hyper-V was mentioned several time during the discussion but there is no mention from Platform9, including their website when or if they plan on supporting, sorry Jeff.5. Updates / Patches ‚Äì One of the biggest pains is having to keep up with updates or patches, well don‚Äôt have to worry about it here. Platform9 does all the heavy lifting. Maintaining at least 1 version behind the latest releases and providing at least a months notice prior to update. They also maintain a regular patch cycle providing a weeks notice prior to patching. They also follow this approach internally within their own environment.6. Agents ‚Äì The magic really starts when you download and install the bootstrap agent provided to your specific environment once you sign up for an account. These are light weight agents that will be installed on your Linux servers and in the case of vSphere an OVF appliance. A few things to keep in mind when it comes to the agents:  You only have to install an agent on the servers you want to be part of your private cloud in Platform9.  The agent then goes through a discovery process, gathering information from your infrastructure that will later be displayed on your dashboard.  Any install packages will be discovered as well.  Any changes made on the hosts outside the dashboard are still reported through the agents. It‚Äôs assumed that with root privileges also comes great responsibility.  Security is built in. All communication is encrypted between the agent and the control plane (hosted by Platform9).7. Data ‚Äì Is using a cloud based management tool to communicate to on-premises infrastructure safe for our data? The answer here is yes. Platform9 has absolutely no insight to your data. As stated above, the agent does a discovery of the infrastructure and reports back to the control plane via encrypted communication. Your data is your data and never leaves, so tell infosec to relax.8. Single Pane of Glass ‚Äì Having multiple platforms to support will require multiple management tools right? Not the case here, Platform9 provides a single pane of glass to manage all platforms running within your infrastructure. I personally really enjoy the simple uncluttered look of the Web UI (based on HTML5). The Web UI is very responsive and lacks all the unnecessary animation. Here is a list of some of the features available through the self service portal:  Two role based groups  Dashboard displaying current and used resources of compute, memory, storage, and network  Infrastructure mappings  Host Role Assignment / Tagging  Deployment Customization9. Monitoring / Troubleshooting ‚Äì Platform9 continuously monitors your infrastructure and maintains its health but also can detect issues before you do. This causes more work for them but ensures that customers get the best service they can possibly get.10. Reporting ‚Äì So with all these great features we didn‚Äôt hear anything about reporting. Well no solution will have everything day one but also keep in mind in order to keep things simple they can‚Äôt add all the bells and whistles. In the case of reporting you can currently leverage the APIs to create your own custom reports. Platform9 is also working towards adding custom reporting to all administrators to have more visibility into tenant usage and history.*Bonus*Since I mentioned 10 reasons above here are a few honorable mentions.Security ‚Äì How secure is this solution you ask? well the following measures are in place:  Control plane communicates over HTTPS to receive meta data.  Multi-factor authentication.  Dedicated account per customer.  Access to restricted networks.APIs ‚Äì Native OpenStack API‚Äôs are available as well as some from Platform9.Backups ‚Äì Control plane is backed up every night with a retention policy of 30 days.When looking at Platform9 some VMware administrators will be quick to compare it to something like vRA (vCAC). Although both may provide some of the same features such as a self service portal and multi-tenancy, to name a few. Platform9 requires no initial knowledge and large IT department, where as vRA (vCAC) requires a lot of knowledge, skill set and time to fully have a private cloud in place. Platform9 also leverages the OpenStack community which allows them to add more features quickly, but they also plan on contributing so its a win-win situation. Another thing to consider is that Platform9 may not be for everyone, true they target customers with 50-5000 physical servers, but there may be some companies who‚Äôs culture is not ready or security team comfortable with allowing internet access to their private cloud. I plan to leverage Platform9 to deploy and learn OpenStack in my lab, especially since the Lite tier comes with a great price point (free)."

    "content": "In a previous post, we created a Windows Server repository for updates. This repository will serve to upgrade both the Identity Appliance and vRA Appliance(s). Before upgrading we need to ensure backups are in place. I know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir, but still need to stress the importance. We are not short of ways to backup the environment using VM snapshots (temporarily) and vSphere data protection to name a few. For SQL using a maintenance plan is also an option. The success of the upgrade relies on following the correct order. The steps below follow a simple deployment model but I will try to add areas where a distributed model differs.Upgrade Steps  Backup Identity Appliance, vRA Appliance(s), IaaS database, and IaaS server(s).  Stop vRA Appliance(s) Services.  Stop IaaS Server(s) services.  Identity Appliance Upgrade.  vRA Appliance Upgrade.  IaaS Database Upgrade.  IaaS Upgrade.Prerequisites  Log in the vRA Appliance(s) via SSH or VM console and disable the vco-service running the following commands: service vco-server stop &amp; chkconfig vco-server off.  The following services also need to be stopped on all vRA Appliances:          service vcac-server stop      service apache2 stop      service rabbitmq-server stop        Check the services have been stopped use the status command, ex: service vco-server status.  Shutdown the following services on the IaaS server ( make sure services are stopped on all servers in a distributed model):          All VMware vCloud Automation Center agents      All VMware DEM workers      VMware DEM orchestrator      VMware vCloud Automation Cneter Manager Service      Note: Do not reboot any of the servers or start the services until the upgrade process is complete.Appliance(s) UpgradeUpdate the Identity appliance followed by the vRA Appliance. The upgrade procedure is similar for both appliances.  Log in the appliance(s).          Identity Appliance: https://Identity Appliance FQDN:5480.      vRA Appliance: https://vRA Appliance FQDN:5480.        Select the Update tab, then click settings.  Ensure to select a repository type, in this case I‚Äôm using a specified repository.   Save settings and click status.  Click Check Updates and then Install Updates. Wait patiently until updates are applied.  IaaS Upgrade  Navigate to https://vRA Appliance FQDN:5480/i or installer.  Download the database upgrade scripts.   Extract the DBUpgrade.zip.  Open a command prompt with Administrator privileges and navigate to the DBUgrade directory.  Run the DBUpgrade.exe command using the switches below:          -S SQL instance, port if needed      -d DBname      -E Windows Authentication or -U SQL login      -l upgrade log ‚Äì default is DBUpgrade directory         Note: VMware‚Äôs documentation states to run this command only once, make sure a DB backup is taken prior to upgrade.    Download the IaaS installer from the vRA Appliance (step 1) and don‚Äôt change the file name.  Run the installer with Administrator privileges.  Click Next on the Welcome to the vCloud Automation Center Configuration screen.   Accept the EULA, click Next.  Enter the vRA Appliance root account and password, check Accept Certificate and click Next.  Select Upgrade and click Next.  Select the components to upgrade (my setup has all components on the same server). Verify service account information and add database information. Click Next.Note: In a distributed model the following upgrade order must be used:          Websites      Manager Services      DEM orchestrator and workers      Agents        Confirm all components are listed and click Upgrade.  Once the upgrade is complete click Next.  vRA upgrade is now complete, click Finish.  Verify all required services are started on vRA Appliance(s) and IaaS Server(s).vRA BrandingWhile this step is optional, it allows the product to display the new branding that marketing has bestowed upon us.  Log in the vRA Appliance https://vRA Appliance FQDN:5480.  Select the Setting tab and click the SSO tab.  Enter SSO setting and check Apply Branding then save settings.  There you have it from start to finish, the upgrade process is really not that difficult once all the steps are followed in order. You can now delete those temporary snapshots üôÇ"

    "content": "To take advantage of the new features that vRA 6.2 has to offer, it‚Äôs time to upgrade. The upgrade will make it easier to transition from the vCAC branding to vRA. This was also a good time to start thinking about how to go about the process.Upgrade Choices  Download Updates directly from VMware ‚Äì requires internet access.  Internal repository (offline bundle) ‚Äì restricted internet access.  Update with CD-ROM ‚Äì restricted internet access / requires enabled CD-ROM.The easiest way to update is from the VMware repository using the internet. I had to consider my past experiences working in silo environments. Then I had to think about my current role as a consultant and my customers. With these experiences in mind it made more sense to explore other options. Update with CD-ROM is the second easiest but I had consider who has access to what. The person applying the updates may not be the same person who has access to edit the VMs. We also have a tendency of downloading the same ISO several times when we can‚Äôt find it. The worst is having several copies of the same ISO scattered in different directories on the network. It made more sense to create a centralized repository for updates. The repository would provide more control and management over which updates are available. This would be a guaranteed method for servers with limited or no internet access to receive updates. Finally, if the server has repository access, it eliminates worrying over user VM permissions.This post will walk through the configuration of a repository on a Windows Server. Why Windows? Well I already have a Windows Server 2012 R2 server available for management. Also I couldn‚Äôt find documentation on setting one up, fair enough? üôÇWindows Server 2012 R2  Add the Web Server (IIS) server role.   Add the prompted features required for the Web Server (IIS).   Take the defaults on Features,Web Server Role (IIS), Role Services and click Next.  Confirm all the setting you selected are correct and click Install.   Create a directory for your repository. Note: You can always go back and add other features, if needed.Setting up IIS  Open IIS Manager.  In the Connections Pane expand the server.  Expand Sites and right click Default Web Site, select Add Virtual Directory. Note: Here I‚Äôm using the Default Web Site, but a new one can be created if you choose.   Add an Alias and Physical path.   Click Test Settings, make sure at least you pass authentication, click Close and OK.  Double click on Directory Browsing, set the action (right side) to enable.   Open a web browser and verify access to your virtual directory.   Go to Default Web Site and select MIME Types.  Add the following MIME type .sig with a file/download type (file located under the manifest directory in updates).    The following command is needed since the update will stop due to the + characters in some of the update files (security risk). More info can be found here.%windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd set config ‚ÄúDefault Web Site‚Äù -section:system.webServer /security/requestfiltering -allowDoubleEscaping:trueAppliance SetupNote: I will be using the vRA appliance to test.

Select the use Specified Repository radio button.  Repository URL will be http://webserver FQDN/virtual directory name/path to update.  Note: I created a directory for each appliance update  Save Settings.  Go to Status ‚Äì&gt; Check Updates   Click Install Updates. Note: Update will take a while, which means time for a break!  Once the update is complete, reboot the appliance.  Validate new version. I didn‚Äôt focus much on security since this was in my lab. Things to consider are permissions on your directories and adding Secure HTTP. Check the documentation of the appliance(s) to verify supported update methods."

IaaS also has some muscle behind it in regards to extensibility. Before getting too far in this discussion, let‚Äôs go through the IaaS installation process.IaaS Server Requirements  Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 / Windows Server 2012 R2  Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1  PowerShell version 2.0 or 3.0  Microsoft IIS 7.5  Java (64-bit) 1.7 or later (32-bit version of Java is not supported)  vRA service accountIaaS Server Prep  Add the vRA service account to the IaaS server‚Äôs local administrators group.  Select Local Security Policy under Tools from the Server Manager.  Expand Local Policies and select User Rights Assignment.  Add the vRA service account to the following policies:          Log on as a batch job      Log on as a service            Open Component Services, Start ‚Äì&gt; run ‚Äì&gt; dcomcnfg or Start ‚Äì&gt; Administrative Tools ‚Äì&gt; Component Services.  Expand Component Services ‚Äì&gt; Computers ‚Äì&gt; My Computer ‚Äì&gt; Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC).  Right click the Local DTC and select Properties. Under the security tab check Network DTC Access, Allow Remote Clients, Allow Remote Administration, Allow Inbound and Allow Outbound under Transaction Manager Communication.   Click OK and allow the service to be restarted.  Open Services and change the Secondary Logon service to automatic.  Start the Secondary Logon service.  Add the IIS Web Server Role.  Add the following Features:          NET Framework 3.5 Feature with Non-HTTP Activation.      NET Framework 4.5 Feature &amp; WCF Services.      Windows Process Activation Service ‚Äì All.            Under Role services add the following:          expand Security and select Windows Authentication.      expand Application Development and select ASP, ASP.NET 3.5, ASP.NET4.5.        Install the selected roles and features.IIS Configuration  Open IIS Manager.  Navigate to the Default Web Site.   Under IIS select Authentication making the following changes:          Disable Anonymous Authentication.      Enable Windows Authentication.      Click Advanced Settings, disable Enable Kernel-mode authentication and then click OK.      Click Providers, remove Negotiate and NTLM and click OK.      Click Advanced Settings, check Enable Kernel-mode authentication and then click OK.      Click Providers, add Negotiate and NTLM and click OK.        Close IIS Manager.Java Configuration  Download a 64-bit version of Java 1.7 or later ( using version 7 Update 71 in my lab).  Install Java.  Go to Control Panel ‚Äì&gt; System ‚Äì&gt; Advance system settings ‚Äì&gt; Advanced Tab ‚Äì&gt; Environment Variables.  Create a new Environment Variable called JAVA_HOME.  Variable value is the installation path of the Java bin directory ‚ÄúC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\‚Äù. Note: variable name must all be in Caps.Prerequisites ScriptAfter going through all that you must be thinking, there has to be an easier way to do this. Well there is, thanks to Brian Graf. His prereq script goes through this process saving time and less room for error. It‚Äôs always good to go through the manual process at least once. It helps understand the process and good for troubleshooting.http://blogs.vmware.com/PowerCLI/2014/09/vcac-6-1-pre-req-automation-script-released.htmlIaaS Install  Navigate to https://vRA Appliance FQDN:5480/i  Download the IaaS installer Note: Don‚Äôt rename the installer file, it is tied to the vRA appliance.  Right-click the IaaS Installer and run it as Administrator   Click Next on the Welcome to the vCloud Automation Center Configuration screen.   Accept the EULA and click Next.   Use the vRA Appliance root account and password and click Next.  Select installation type complete since this is a lab setup.   Verify Prerequisites, click Next.  Note: If any component(s) doesn‚Äôt pass PreReq checker, click that item and view instructions to configure correctly. Then click Check Again to verify component(s) have passed.  Enter the service account password and passphrase. Since we are already logged in with the service account it has pre-populated the username for us.  Enter Microsoft SQL Server Database Install Information, click Next.Note: Don‚Äôt lose your passphrase, it‚Äôs required to provide the encryption key for other IaaS components.  Distributed Executions Managers: provide names for the DEM Worker &amp; Orchestrator.  Proxy vSphere Agent: name can be changed but make note of it as it is required when adding your endpoint. Click Next.  Provide the following in the Component Registry:          Click on Load to load the SSO Default tenant.      Click on Download to pull in the vRA Automation certificate.      Select Accept Certificate.      Enter the administrator@vsphere.local account credentials and click Test.      Verify the IaaS Server FQDN and click Next.            Verify the components information and click Install.  The install process will take some time to complete, good time to take a break!Verify IaaS Services &amp; Tenant  Once the IaaS install is complete, verify the following services are running:          VMware DEM-Orchestrator      VMware DEM-Worker      VMware vCloud Automation Center Agent      VMware vCloud Automation Center Service            Log in the default tenant https://vRA FQDN/shell-ui-app using administrator@vsphere.local.The IaaS deployment can seeing daunting at times, especially going through it the first time. One piece of advice is to use snapshots during this process. They come in handy if you must revert back to a previous state of the deployment, just don‚Äôt forget to clean up when done. Also if you run into any errors during the IaaS install there is a link to open the installer log folder at the bottom of the installer. Once you vRealize the error of your ways, uninstall and re-install or just revert from snapshot."

    "content": "Recently we discussed how to setup the IaaS database. Did you know there are scripts available to do the IaaS database install? There is a catch to using the scripts to pre-create the IaaS database, anyone? anyone? A pre-created IaaS database will only work with the custom install (distributed) for the IaaS Server. This supports the two scripted methods, but more on that later.The complete (simple) install will not allow the IaaS installer to continue if the database already exists. The only options are deleting the existing database or creating a new one. This setup may work in a lab environment and maybe if you work in a small shop. Let‚Äôs face it a good database administrator (DBA) on staff is not going to hand over sysadmin rights. The scripts help by allowing the DBA to assess the database deployment. Also allowing the DBA to pre-create the database, removes the need for sysadmin rights in most cases.The two scripted methods for the IaaS database are manual and empty. Manual script uses a batch file to create the database, tables and schema. Did I mention the manual scripted install requires sysadmin rights? Empty script creates an empty database, but relies on the IaaS installer to populate. Here are the steps when using either scripted method.Scripts LocationTypically the SQL scripts can be found in the install guide, but that not the case with vRealize Automation. There are two ways to download the database installation scripts, both requiring the vRA appliance:  The IaaS Install tab from the vRA appliance directly.   Navigating to https://vRA Appliance FQDN:5480/i Manual IaaS Database Scripted MethodBefore starting: Java 1.7 or higher needs to be installed &amp; environment variable for JAVA_HOME must be created.  Download the database installation scripts (DBInstall.zip).  Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the installation scripts zip file.  Extract the DBInstall.zip.  Log in to the SQL server with sufficient rights to create and drop databases, sysadmin privileges are needed within the SQL server instance.  Open a Windows command prompt with administrator rights.  Navigate to DBInstall directory.  Run the following command making the necessary variable changes (variable definitions below). Database Name only requires instance if changed from the default MSSQLSERVER Note: Brackets around the database log directory ‚Äú[log dir]‚Äù in the original script are not needed.

    "content": "Up to this point we had the convenience of deploying appliances for both SSO &amp; vRA. The deployment of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) requires Microsoft Windows &amp; SQL. IaaS uses Microsoft SQL to maintain information about managed virtual machines and policies. Microsoft SQL can either be a remote server deployment or local with IaaS. So before we can setup IaaS we need to have SQL installed, let‚Äôs get started.RequirementsWindows Server 2008 R2 / Server 2012:  DNS (forward / reverse) entry.  TCP / IP protocol enabled.  Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator Service (MSDTC) enabled.  No windows Firewall between Database server (if deployed separately) &amp; IaaS Server  Microsoft SQL 2012 or 2014 / SQL Express (SQL Server Browser service must be running).  SQL Service Account.Required PortsThe vRA Install &amp; Configure document provides the required ports for SQL / IaaS.Database OptionsThe following are a few ways to consider for your SQL deployment:  Deploy a remote SQL server with a blank database, allowing IaaS installer to do the configuration.  Deploy a remote SQL server and using the database installation scripts for configuration.  Install SQL local on IaaS server and use either of the above configuration methods.  Install SQL local on IaaS server allowing IaaS installer to configure.Note: Things to keep in mind for the Database options:  Deployment method: minimal or distributed.  Database high availability.  Backup of Database.Database Setup  Launch the SQL Installer from within your windows machine.  Select installation method of Stand-alone or Cluster. Since this is a lab deployment, I am using a stand-alone installation.   SQL System Configuration Checker will determine if there are or will be issues with the install. If there are any issues, correct before proceeding otherwise click OK.   Enter SQL product key or select a free edition such Express, click Next.   Accept the EULA.  Product Updates can either be installed now or later, for this deployment I have decided to skip the updates for a later time.  SQL Setup Support Rules will verify all prerequisites are met. Note: Make Windows Firewall is either disabled or allows the required ports. Also if working in an isolated environment ignore messages about internet access.  Select SQL Server Feature Installation.   Select the standard features to install, I selected the following to get started as well as kept the default install directories for my lab environment.          Database Engine Services      Client Tools Connectivity      Integration Services      Management Tools         Note: There may be other features that make sense in your database environment.    Verify all and click Next on Installation Rules.  Keep or change the SQL instance name and root directory, click Next.  Disk Space Requirements validates enough space is available for the SQL install. Click Next.  Set the services on the Server Configuration to automatic. I have a SQL service account that will be used for the services.  Use either Windows or Mix Mode Authentication (can be changed after the setup). Things to keep in mind here:          If the IaaS installer is used to create the database with Windows authentication, the installer credentials need the sysadmin role.      If the IaaS installer is used to create the database not using Windows authentication, then SQL credentials with sysadmin role are required.      If the IaaS installer is used to populate a pre-created database require either windows or SQL credentials with db_owner privileges.            Click Next on error reporting, unless you really want to send information to Microsoft.  Start the SQL install and wait for the magic to happen!  Rejoice to the successful completion of the SQL install.Database Settings -MSDTC  Open Component Services, Start ‚Äì&gt; run ‚Äì&gt; dcomcnfg or Start ‚Äì&gt; Administrative Tools ‚Äì&gt; Component Services.  Expand Component Services ‚Äì&gt; Computers ‚Äì&gt; My Computer ‚Äì&gt; Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC).   Right click the Local DTC and select Properties.  Under the security tab check Network DTC Access, Allow Remote Clients and Allow Remote Administration. Updated : also check Allow Inbound and Allow Outbound under Transaction Manager Communication.   Click OK and allow the service to be restarted. Database Settings ‚Äì TCP/IP  Open SQL Server Configuration Manager.  Expand SQL Server network Configuration and click Protocols for MSSQLSERVER.  Verify TCP/IP is enabled. Database CredentialsMake sure to assign the account that will be creating the IaaS database the correct privileges. Sysadmin role unless the database is already pre-created then db_owner privileges will be needed.Now that the SQL database is prepared, we can move forward with the IaaS install."

    "content": "In a previous post, we discussed the importance of SSO as it relates to vRA (vRealize Automation). We also demonstrated how to deploy &amp; configure the vRA identity appliance. Due to the nature of the identity appliance we need to make sure that SSO is in a high available state. There currently is no native HA feature built in, so what are our options for protecting the identity appliance you ask? Here are some options:  The first option is leveraging vSphere HA, which is the recommend method.  The use of FT (Fault Torrance) could be another method; the identity appliance is within the one vCPU boundary.  Deploy the vSphere windows SSO in an HA pair. Some things to keep in mind:          Certificates ‚Äì like it, love it, gotta have it!      vCenter SSO 5.5 U2, U2a, or U2b are supported with vRA 6.1. Although SSO 5.5 U2b is the recommendation.      External load balancer (F5 documented).      How to configure SSO for high availability with vRA 6.1 can be found here.Backups Save Lives!Does having high availability guarantee 99% up time? How often do we design with HA in mind? Yet gremlins, not ones in the movies but the datacenter kind, can cause the unexpected. Better yet are we protected from ourselves, meaning human error? These questions and concerns lead to making sure there is some sort of ‚Äúplan B‚Äù. Backups provide a plan that minimizes your downtime and saves your bacon, yes I said it! SSO is a critical component of any vRA deployment, regular scheduled backups of the should be in place. Especially when changes to configuration, tenants and identity store(s) occur. Here are a few methods to backing up the identity appliance (SSO):  vSphere Data Protection ‚Äì creates a backups of the entire appliance.  vSphere Replication ‚Äì replicate the virtual appliance to another site.  Site Recovery Manager ‚Äì shadow VM copy of the appliance in another datacenter.  Cloning / Snapshot ‚Äì a lot of up keep here, use as temporary solution only.  3rd party backup solutions.Backup of Identity Appliance SSO database using vdcbackup  Log in identity appliance console.  Create a backup directory ‚Äúmkdir /backup‚Äú.  Run the following command ‚Äú/usr/lib/vmware-vmdir/bin/vdcbackup (space) /storage/db/vmware-vmdir /backup/‚Äú.  Verify the following files (data.mdb &amp; lock.mdb)are in the backup directory ‚Äú/backup‚Äù.Note: Copy the cert located in ‚Äú/etc/vmware-sso/keys‚Äù , copy files offline using a tool such as WinSCP.*Bonus: Some Troubleshooting Tips*  VMware Knowledge base is your best friend, most of the errors related to SSO can be found in a knowledge base search.  Know where your logs are located:          Identity appliance -Admin tab ‚Äì&gt; Logs allows creation of support bundle or see KB 2074803.      vSphere SSO ‚Äì %Temp% in windows explorer , see KB 2033430.        Verify NTP is configured and synced correctly.  If possible use certificates from a certificate authority.  Use vdcadmintool to unlock and reset SSO administrator password.  SSO administrator password in identity appliance has an expiration date (Admin tab ‚Äì&gt; Administrator settings). Only current option is change password.  SSO password in vSphere expires in 90 days by default, password policies can be adjusted.Thanks to Kyle Ruddy for his input towards SSO troubleshooting. With SSO highly available and backed up, we can now set our sites on deploying the vCAC appliance."

    "content": "The introduction of Single Sign On (SSO) in vSphere 5.1 has provided a new major dependency of the infrastructure. SSO provides a secure way of authenticating to your vSphere environment. It not only serves as an authentication broker but also a token exchange, so what does this all mean you? In a nutshell this is a handshake.When logging in a vSphere environment (C# client or Web Client) it sends a token to SSO containing username &amp; password. In turn SSO authenticates against the selected identity source. An identity source can be Active Directory, Open LDAP or Local OS. SSO can also support more than one identity source.Once the original token authenticates, SSO issues a security token. This becomes your key.Access to VMware products such as vCenter is now permitted. At this point you must be asking what does SSO have to do with vRealize Automation? Well its simple, vRealize Automation (formerly vCloud Automation Center) or vRA uses SSO as well. In fact SSO is one of the core deployment components, without it vRA would not function.Before we get started, we have to be sure we have everything we need:Prerequisites  DNS (forward / reverse) entry.

    "content": "Last week I had the opportunity to be one of the 1200 + (estimated) in attendance for VeeamON in Las Vegas, a conference themed around datacenter availability. Of course remember what happens in Vegas, goes on twitter #VeeamON. The conference was filled with lots of activities such as lab warz, tour of the modern datacenter and training for the Veeam Certified Engineer (VMCE) just to name a few. Although three days, well four for those who attended the VMCE training, the agenda was quite full:  Sunday ‚Äì Registration, Partner Reception / Dinner  Monday ‚Äì Partner Keynote, Breakout Sessions, Expo Lounge Opening / Reception  Tuesday ‚Äì General Session Keynote, Breakout Sessions, VeeamON Party!  Wednesday ‚Äì Breakout Sessions, General Keynote , General Departure  *Thursday ‚Äì VMCE training (for those who signed up)*Keynotes Conference keynotes can either be entertaining to draw the focus of the attendees or mundane and lose it with presentations like death by PowerPoint. This is not the case here, from the first day‚Äôs partner keynote which right from the gate was injected with humor and had a talk show vibe. Ratmir Timashev was one guest, who shared his journey as well as the vision of the company. Other guest speakers include Chris Moore and Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit who provided an entertaining closing keynote.SessionsEach day had tracks geared towards different skill and audience type, ranging from Partners (pre /post-sales), Technical and Business. With the exception of the last day, sessions started around 1 pm. This type of schedule is refreshing as it takes to account the prior evening activities and gives the attendees a chance to recover.Announcements During the conference the first announcement was around Veeam Availability suite v8, which incorporates new features such as:  Veeam Explorer for Storage snapshots NetApp / HP,  Veeam Explorer for MS Exchange, SharePoint, SQL and AD.  Cloud Connect,  Support for EMC Data Domain,  End to end encryption  Replication enchantmentsTo get more info on Veeam Availability suite v8 and its release check out http://go.veeam.com/availability-suite-v8The top secret announcement was a standalone product called Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE, yes FREE! This product supports the backups of physical endpoints such as Windows desktop and laptops running Windows 7 and higher but also supports Windows Server 2008 and higher. These endpoints can be backed up to internal / external drives, NAS or a Veeam Backup Repository which is saved in a VBK format the same as Veeam‚Äôs Backup &amp; Replication product. Another great feature available in this product is the ability to create bootable media for recovery. To find out more and see when it will be available in 2015, sign up for the beta here: http://go.veeam.com/endpointCommunity / ExpoThe presence of the community was seen all round the conference from the presenters, Veeam User group and vBrownBag. Within the expo lounge you could see the support of sponsors such as VMware, NetApp, HP, Cisco and Microsoft just to name a few. In the middle of the expo lounge was the stage of the vBrownBag, filled with two days of tech talks from folks such as Rick Vanover, Chris Wahl, Chris Colotti and Phoummala Schmit just to name a few. Check out all the tech talks here , which I also had an opportunity to take part of. During the evenings the expo lounge severed as a reception area before dinner. Party!I have been fortunate enough to attend several Veeam parties both in the US and EMEA, lets just say they never disappoint. The Light nightclub at Mandalay was the location filled with dancers, DJs and Vegas style lighting everywhere. Of course it was a great opportunity to catch up with friends and network.ConclusionOverall the vibe of the conference was great as most did not know what to expect for the first event. It will be interesting to see what Veeam has in store for 2015? Location, location, location, will they keep the event at in Vegas? Also will the next event have an open submissions to allow more presenters from the community but also more sessions as the conference continues to grow. Hopefully we will see a survey to allow those who attended to provide feedback. The bar has been set high and I am sure Veeam will continue to surpass.You can catch the VeeamON recap this Wednesday (10/15/14) on Whiteboard Wednesdays "

    "content": "The first post in this series discussed how to deploy the NetApp Simulator in your vSphere environment. Now we will move forward with the configuration of the first node &amp; cluster.Booting the DataONTAP Simulator 1st Node  Open the simulator vSphere client console, press Ctrl-C for the Boot Menu when displayed on the screen.   Once the boot menu is loaded, select Opt 4 ‚Äù Clean configuration and initialize all disks.‚Äù   At the zero disk, reset config and install a new file system prompt, type ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúy‚Äù and press Enter. Confirm the selection and press enter.  The simulator VM restarts and will continue the initialization process. Do not interrupt this process as it might result in corruption of the simulator disks.Creating the Cluster  At the ‚ÄúWelcome to the cluster setup wizard‚Äù screen you will be prompted to create or join a cluster. Since this is the first node in the cluster type create and press enter.   When prompted ‚ÄúDo you intend for this node to be used as a single node cluster‚Äù, continue with the default no and press enter.   Allow the cluster network to use network switches and press enter.  When creating the cluster interfaces (e0a &amp; e0b) you have the option of keeping the system defaults or changing the network defaults during the cluster configuration.   Once the cluster interfaces are created, enter the name of your cluster &amp; license key(s).  Create a cluster admin password.   Enter the required network information for the cluster management interface.  Enter the required network information for the node management interface.  Cluster creation is now complete.   Management for the NetApp cluster or node(s) is now accessible via CLI or GUI (browser based) by downloading the OnCommand System Manager.  To validate your cluster setup via CLI, log in and run ‚Äúcluster show.‚Äù Next steps include the configuration and addition of a secondary node to the cluster as well as provisioning of storage."

    "content": "Simulators can be very useful tools to learn most of a products features. They can also serve as test platforms for updates, scripts, migrations, etc without the fear of affecting your production environment and causing a resume generating event. NetApp simulates its Data ONTAP software allowing for support for a majority of its functionality within a virtual environment. Supported VMware environments consists of Workstation, Player, Fusion and vSphere. This install process covers deploying the Data ONTAP simulator in cluster mode on a vSphere 5.5 lab environment.Prerequisites  NetApp Now account with appropriate access, consult with your NetApp rep for further information.  Download the Simulator that meets the needs of your environment as there are separate downloads if using vSphere or Workstation, etc.  Cluster mode requires 3 IPs per node for setup.  Storage for simulator.Create a NetApp Cluster Network vSphere Web Client*Cluster Mode requires a dedicated network for the cluster traffic*vSwitch (Per host configuration)  Select an ESXi host.  Go to the Manage tab and select Networking.  In the Virtual Switches view, click Add host networking (globe with plus sign).  In the Add host networking wizard select Virtual Machine Port Group for a Standard Switch as the connection type, click Next.  Determine whether to use a separate vSwitch or to use an existing one as the target device. Keep in mind that the port group requires no connectivity to any uplinks. In this example I am using a new standard switch, click Next.  Note : if existing standard switch is selected the wizard goes directly to Connection Settings (step #8).  This network is for inter VM communication no uplinks are required, click Next.  A warning that there no active physical network adapters for the vSwitch are connected, click OK.  Provide a Network Label ‚ÄúNetApp Cluster Network‚Äù and VLAN ID if required, click Next.  Verify the vSwitch information is correct and click Finish.  A new vSwitch with no uplinks is created.dvSwitch (One time configuration)  From the Home tab select Networking under the inventories.  Verify if there is a Distributed Switch. If one exists then create a new port and go to step #8  Right click and select New Distributed Switch.  New Distributed Switch wizard is launched, Provide a Name and Click Next.  Select the dvSwitch version based on your environment.  Provide the correct settings for your environment (# of uplinks, Default port group, etc), click Next.  Verify the Distributed Switch information is correct and click Finish.  Right click the port group for your NetApp Cluster Network and edit settings.  Select Teaming and failover.  Uplink failover order should have all uplinks set to Unused.  A warning that there no active physical network adapters for the port group on the dvSwitch are connected, click OK.Registering Data ONTAP Simulator 1st Node on vSphere  From the Home tab select Storage under the inventories.  Select an existing or create a new datastore that will host the files for the simulator.  Upload the simulator files to the selected datastore.  Register the simulator VM by locating the .vmx file called ‚ÄúDataONTAP.vmx‚Äù.  Right click .vmx file and Register VM.  Provide a name and folder location, click Next.  Select a cluster or host.  Verify registered VM information, click Finish.  Right click on the VM and assign the four NICs to the correct networks (2 cluster / 2 data). By default a inaccessible ‚ÄúCluster Network‚Äù is created and will go away once the Cluster NICs have a network assigned.  When trying to power on your simulator an error ‚ÄúFile/vmfs/volumes/‚ÄùDatastore‚Äù/NetappSimulator/DataONTAP-sim.vmdk was not found.‚Äù The reason for this is the ‚Äúsim.vmdk‚Äù is a sparse disk (split in 2GB files). Here are some options to help fix :  On the ESXi console run the following command vmkload_mod multiextent (this will need to be ran on any host that will have a simulator). Warning / Caution if host is rebooted command will need to be re-run.  Use VMware Converter.  ESXi command line use vmkfstools to convert the VM disk: vmkfstools -i ‚ÄúCurrent VM disk name‚Äù ‚ÄúNew VM disk name‚Äù -d zeroedthick or thin.  Delete the current disk and add a new eager zero thick disk or thin disk.11. Power on VM.At this point the first node is hopefully powered on and booting. Next steps will be getting the node configured and adding another node to the cluster."
